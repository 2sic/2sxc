/// History:
/// 
/// * Added in v13
/// * Made compatible to <see cref="ITypedItem"/> in 16.02 to allow typed commands such as `.String(...)`
/// * Renamed in v16.02 from `IDynamicMetadata` to `IMetadata` since it's not necessarily `dynamic` any more (but still supports `dynamic` where needed)
///     _Note that this is a breaking change, but we believe the type is never directly mentioned in any code_
/// * Renamed in v20 to `ITypedMetadata` from `IMetadata` because it kept on causing confusions
/// </remarks>

/// Helper on [`Kit.Link`](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.ServiceKit16.Link) to create links to pages, APIs and images.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It is usually also available as a `Link` object in every Razor and WebApi file.
/// 
/// This helps create links to:
/// 
/// - Pages
/// - APIs
/// - Images
///
/// As well as create base-tag links (important for SPAs)
///
/// You will never create this yourself, as get this automatically in Razor or WebAPIs on an object called `Link`.
/// 
/// History
/// 
/// - Created ca. v2 as `ToSic.Sxc.Web.ILinkHelper`
/// - Moved to this new `Services.ILinkService` in v13.05. The previous name will continue to work, but newer features will be missing on that interface. 
/// </remarks>

    ///// - null/empty/default means that the link is returned as given - as provided by the 'url' parameter. if none was provided, it's a root-absolute link like `/xyz/abc?stuff#stuff`
    ///// - `full` means full protocol, domain and everything - like https://2sxc.org/dnn-tutorials/page/subpage/?product=27&filter=42#test=42
    /////     - if a url is provided without protocol, it's assumed that it's on the current site, so the current domain/protocol are added
    /////     - when no url or params was provided would just result in the domain + link to the current page as is
    /////     - if the url seems invalid (like `hello:there` or an invalid `file:593902` reference) nothing is added
    ///// - `protocol` would just return the "http", "https" or whatever.
    /////     - if no url was provided, it will assume that the current page is to be used
    /////     - if a url was provided and it has no protocol, then the current protocol is used
    /////     - if a url was provided with protocol, it would return that
    ///// - `domain` would just return the full domain like `2sxc.org`, `www.2sxc.org` or `gettingstarted.2sxc.org`
    /////     - if no url was provided, then the domain of the current page
    /////     - if the url contains a domain, then that domain
    ///// - `hash` would just return the part after the `#` (without the `#`) - if not provided, empty string
    ///// - `query` would return the part after the `?` (without the `?`- if not provided, empty string
    /////     - if no url was provided and there are magical query params (like in DNN), these would not be returned, but not dnn-internals like tabid or language
    ///// - `suffix` would return the entire suffix starting from the `?` _including_ the `?` or `#` - if nothing is there, empty string

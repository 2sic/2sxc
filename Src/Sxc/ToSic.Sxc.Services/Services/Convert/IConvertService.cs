/// Some special things it does:
/// * Strings like "4.2" reliably get converted to int 4 which would otherwise return 0
/// * Numbers like 42 reliably converts to bool true which would otherwise return false
/// * Numbers like 42.5 reliably convert to strings "42.5" instead of "42,5" in certain cultures

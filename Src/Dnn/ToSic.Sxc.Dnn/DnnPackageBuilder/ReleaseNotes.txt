    <b>2sxc v21.01.00</b>
    <br><br>
    Note: 2sxc v20 cleans up a lot of old APIs, so it's called a <a href="https://go.2sxc.org/mot">MoT release</a> (Moment of Truth).
    <br><br>
    If you have old code, things may break and you will be guided to fix the issues.
    <br><br>
    Please read the release notes carefully, do backups, and test-upgrade on a copy before upgrading a live environment.
    See the <a href="https://go.2sxc.org/v20">release blog</a> for more details.

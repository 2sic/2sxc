## Sxc folder

This folder only contains a special folder called:

/ImportExport/Instruction/

Reason is, that these files are always included in an exported App-ZIP. They must be here. 

Ideally we should move them, but then we would have duplicates on existing installations requiring clean-up, so we leave them for now.

This means that a command like this is valid <div @Edit.TagToolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\")> ... </div> ...and this is not <div @Edit.TagToolbar(\"new\", \"BlogPost\")> ... </div> Reason Behind Named Parameters We often have APIs which start simple - like @Edit.TagToolbar() and continue to receive new features. At first, the parameter order will make sense - for that simple use case. But as the API grows, the parameter-order will become strange, simply because we would have to order them in the sequence they were added (to keep compatibility) and not in the order that makes sense. By using named parameters, we're making sure that the parameter order never matters and the API stays stable/compatible for the future. Not all Parameters Require Names Because of historic reasons and because some APIs simply have a very obvious first or second parameter, it may be that the first 1-2 parameters are not named. An example is @Edit.TagToolbar(Content) which assumes that the first parameter without name is the item (entity) for which this toolbar is meant. How It's Implemented Internally the real signature of the command uses a parameter which has a fairly random value. The call then checks if the value of that parameter is this random value, and if not, shows an error. This is to protect you from accidentally using the command without naming the parameters. Note: you could of course work around this, by providing that random value and trick the call to accept unnamed parameters. Don't do this - as we will no guarantee that the API signature (parameter order) will stay the same. History Introduced ca. in 2sxc 6"

    "title": "App / object in Razor | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "App / @App object in Razor Purpose / Description The App object gives you full access to everything you need to know about the current App, including Path-info, access to all Data this App has, access to Settings and language Resources and more. How to use Here's are two simple examples taken from the Blog App : <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/style.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\"/> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"@App.Path/assets/scripts.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\"></script> @foreach(var tag in AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Tag\"])) { <li class='@(\"app-blog-tag\" + tag.ManualWeight)'><a href=\"@App.Settings.DetailsPage/tag/@tag.Tag\" title=\"@tag.Name\">@tag.Name</a></li> } The <link... and <script... use the app-path to ensure that the file is correctly loaded, no matter what portal or app-name is currently valid. Here you can discover more about the optimizations . The loop iterates through all tags with the @foreach(var tag in AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Tag\"])) , creates <li> items and links these to a page defined in the App.Settings . How it works Whenever a 2sxc-instance is created to render a page or to deliver JSON data, the App object is created and prepared to deliver everything you need. It's very performant, because it doesn't actually get any data or run any queries unless these are accessed. App Properties The app-object uses the IApp interface ( see code ) has the following simple properties: AppId number, current App id AppGuid guid, internal use global id Configuration DynamicEntity , contains the configuration content-item Data IAppData, to access all App-data (see below) Folder string, storage folder name in portal/#/2sxc/... Hidden bool, info if the app cannot be selected in the UIs Name string, the app name Path string, the path as used in URLs in html PhysicalPath string, the path as used on the server C:... Query[\"QueryName\"] dictionary of queries (see below) Resources DynamicEntity , all the multi-language labels etc. (see below) Settings DynamicEntity , all the app-settings (see below) ZoneId number, current Zone ID (similar to PortalId) Using App Data (App.Data) The App object gives you immediate acccess to all data in the app, through the Data property. Basically you can use it as follows: Get All Data Items of a Content Type App.Data[\"ContentTypeName\"] will give you a stream of all entities of that type. In most cases you'll use an AsDynamic(...) to use it efficiently in loops etc. because most of the razor templating will prefer a DynamicEntity to a pure IEntity-object. Here's an example: @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(App.Data[\"BlogPost\"])) { @RenderPage(\"_list-item.cshtml\", new { Post = post }) } note : this will give you all items, but you'll have to sort it using LINQ or other mechanisms. If you're not familiar with that, you're better of using App.Query[...] (see below). Edit App Data Content-Items In addition to giving access to all entities in this app, you can also create, edit and delete items using the App.Data object. The commands provided are: App.Data.Create(contentTypeName, values, userName) App.Data.Update(entityId, values, userName) App.Data.Delete(entityId, userName) You can read more about this in the App Data API Feature Using App Queries (App.Query) The queries you create in the app-configuration dialogs can do many things like filter certain items, order them and more. You will often just connect them to a template and visualize the result, by you can also use it in your code. Here's how: @foreach(var tag in AsDynamic(App.Query[\"SortedTags\"][\"Default\"])) { <li class='@(\"app-blog-tag\" + tag.ManualWeight)'><a href='@Link.To(\"tag= \" tag.Tag)' title=\"@tag.Name\">@tag.Name</a></li> } Technically the App.Query is a IDictionary<string, IDataSource> , meaning that it's a dictionary using string identifiers (names), returning an IDataSource object. It's important to realize that a DataSource can deliver multiple streams of data - a bit like delivering multiple tables. Each stream has a name, and you must specify which stream you want to work with. In the above example, we're using the Default stream as defined with App.Query[\"SortedTags\"][\"Default\"] . Note about Unpublished / Draft Content-Items In case you're not aware of the draft/unpublished features in 2sxc, we want to note that each item can be live/draft, and each item could have a corresponding counterpart. So a draft-item could have a live-item (but doesn't have to), and a live-item could have a draft item. This is important, because the admin/editor will see all the draft items, while the end-user will only see the live ones. So the exact items shown and the item-count can differ if you are logged in. App Settings and Resources In the App dialogs you can manage Settings and Resources . Basically both are a content-item with the fields you specify, the only difference is the purpose they have. You should put button-labels, standard-texts, decorative images etc. into Resources and these will often change from language to language. You should put settings like \"what page is xxx on\" or \"the primary color is #53aaff\" into Settings You would normally use it like this: <h1 class='@App.Settings.HeadingsDecorators'> @Content.Title </h1> <div> @Content.Body </div> <a href=\"@App.Settings.DisclaimerPage\"> @App.Resources.Disclaimer </a> As you can see, the HeadingsDecorators or DisclaimerPage are best placed in the Settings , while the label of the Disclaimer link are best handled as a multi-language Resource . Read also If you need to get an App object for other apps, read External App Use If you want to use the App object from non 2sxc-code, like other MVC pages, check out External App Use Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Blog App showing many such features More links: App Data Create/Update/Delete History Introduced in 2sxc 05.05 Stable since 2sxc 06.00 Data-API was introduced in 2sxc 06.05"

    "title": "Event CustomizeSearch() on the Razor Page | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Event CustomizeSearch() on the Razor Page Purpose / Description This event is called by the view-engine after calling CustomizeData and before passing the Data object to the DNN Search Indexer. You can override this event to change how data is presented to the search, for example by bundling items together, or by giving items different URLs so that search knows that they are to appear on a sub-page. How to use In your razor page (.cshtml file) you can add a script block implementing this, as follows: @functions { // this method is optional - your code wouldn't need it, but it's in here to show how it would work together // the CustomizeData would be called first, and potentially modify what is in the Data-object public override void CustomizeData() { // Don't customize anything, nothing to customize in this case } /// <summary> /// Populate the search - ensure that each entity has an own url/page /// </summary> /// <param name=\"searchInfos\"></param> /// <param name=\"moduleInfo\"></param> /// <param name=\"startDate\"></param> public override void CustomizeSearch(Dictionary<string, List<ToSic.SexyContent.Search.ISearchInfo>> searchInfos, DotNetNuke.Entities.Modules.ModuleInfo moduleInfo, DateTime startDate) { foreach (var si in searchInfos[\"Default\"]) { si.QueryString = \"mid=\"+ moduleInfo.ModuleID + \"&feature=\" + si.Entity.EntityId; } } } The code above will skip customizing any data (but often you would want that too), then CustomizeSearch modifies the list of search-items before they are indexed. How it works In general everything will work automatically. This is what happens: 2sxc will retrieve the data added to this module 2sxc will call the CustomizeData() event if the template has such an event. In this event, your code can add more data to the module as needed. Note that during the search index, no Request-variables exist. So your method will cause an error if it does something like var x = Request[\"Category\"]. In case of an error, the index will still continue to work, but your changes to the data will fail To help you with this, a new property called InstancePurpose was added. It tells you if this view/template was created for displaying or for indexing. 2sxc will then use the data and create SearchItems, ready to index. Each entity will be turned into a SearchItem Each Content-Type will have an own list (so you can differentiate between all the SearchItems for the Categories and the SearchItems for the Questions) Multi-Language is handled correctly, so the English index will contain the English content, etc. 2sxc will then call a CustomizeSearch() event, so your code could provide changes. A common scenario is to say that each entity (say each question) has a different URL (say a details-page). So even though all entities belong to the module (and DNN only knows of this one module), the module can say that each entity has an own details page.

    "keywords": "@Data in Razor Template What is Data A 2sxc instance is a running 2sxc-engine which is about to execute some code (Razor, Token or a web service) together with some content-items which should be used in this case. These content-items are provided to the code in an object called Data . 2sxc will decide what items to deliver, based on the situation. In most cases, a DNN-Module will show a 2sxc-template, and the content-editor will manually add items to it using the normal web-UI. In this case, these items will be tied to this use-case and 2sxc will deliver them in the Data object. In other cases, the template (or view) will be configured to get data from a query configered elsewhere. In this case, all data retrieved in the query will be provided in the same Data object. There are also cases, where a template needs both queried data (like all categories ) as well as content-items added manually. There are multiple easy ways of doing this todo - document later Note: if you want all data of a type, like \"Get me all Tag-items in the system\" you need to use App-Data . Most common way to use the Data object In all Razor-templates and also the web-api files, the Data object is already created and ready to access. Here's a code example: <div class=\"app-blog\"> @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"])) { // do something with the @post here } </div> the foreach will loop through all items of the data in the Stream Default - read more about streams below the var post is the inner variable containing the current item the AsDynamic will ensure that the items we're working with are easy to code with, because they are Dynamic Entities The Streams in a Data Object The data object can have multiple Streams , each containing a list of items. In most cases you'll just have the Default stream, which you can access using Data[\"Default\"] . Read more about streams in the Stream docs But you may also have additional streams, depending on what has been configured in the data-preparation stuff (usually a visual query). For example, if you are working on a view showing one product and a menu with all possible categories, then your query may have these streams: Book (the current book, this stream has 1 item with the ID matching the ID in the URL) Categories (all categories in the system, sorted A-Z) The code would then look a bit like this: var book = Data[\"Book\"].FirstOrDefault(); // returns an IEntity Object var cats = Data[\"Categories\"]; // returns an IEnumerable of iEntity objects Or in most cases, because of the simpler syntax later on: var book = AsDynamic(Data[\"Book\"].FirstOrDefault()); // returns one dynamic entity var cats = AsDynamic(Data[\"Categories\"]); // returns an IEnumerable of dynamic entities Changing what is provided by Data The main configuration of the template will determine, what data is initially provided to the template. Afterwards, other mechanisms can override / change this. Initial Sources Default type/list configuration - this can determine that 0, 1 or many items (of a certain type) are delivered if one or many are delivered, then the selection will be based on what the editor added to the module instance. Visual Query - if the template has a query attached, this query will deliver the data Modifications to the source for the template The event CustomizeData can optionally completely reconfigure what Data contains in your code. Data Object API The Data object itself is actually a normal EAV IDataSource . So if you need to know more about the internals, read it up there. All other properties of the Data object are very special use only, so you probably shouldn't bother about them - which is why they are not documented here."

    "keywords": "Link / @Link Object in Razor / .net Purpose / Description Basically you can always link around to other pages, websites or views using normal <a href=\"...\">text</a> html. And often you just want to add some parameters to the current Url like ?id=27 - but the behavior of this can be very different depending on the DNN settings. The Link object helps you handle this. Note: DNN often has a problem with links, because depending on what page you are on, the behaviour is a bit different. This is especially important on the home page. Use @Link.To(...) to make sure everything works no matter what. How to use Here's a quick example of using the Link object in a Razor template: <a href=\"@Link.To(parameters: \"id=\" + item.EntityId)\"> @item.Title </a> This example creates a link to the current page, adding either ?id=27 or /id/27 , depending on the DNN configuration. How it works The Link -object is always available in all Razor-templates. Internally it uses the DNN API to get the correct url. Using @Link.To() Example: @Link.To(parameters: \"id=17\") @Link.To(parameters: \"id=403&category=all\") Using @Link.Base() for JavaScript SPA modules This is new in 2sxc v9.5.1. It ensures that the url can be used for SPAs, as some pages will otherwise provide a wrong link (like home) which then breaks the SPA. <base href=\"@Link.Base()\"> Notes and Clarifications Object and Interfaces The Edit-Object is of type ToSic.SexyContent.Interfaces.ILinkHelper . Enforced Parameter Naming To promote long term API stability, we require all parameters to be named when used.

For long term stability, we only use interfaces in the API. To better understand this stuff, best read about the EAV Core Data Models . In most cases you only care about the IEntity interface and things below that. Classes Attribute<T> Represents an Attribute / Property of an Entity with Values of a Generic Type ContentType Represents a ContentType ContentTypeAttribute Defines an attribute with name and the type this attribute has. Part of of a IContentType definition. ContentTypeMetadata Provides metadata for a content type. This can be very special, because ContentTypes can be shared (ghosts), in which case the metadata must be retrieved from another \"remote\" location (where the original is defined). DimensionDefinition The definition of a dimension / language EntityBasedType Foundation for a class which gets its data from an Entity. This is used for more type safety - because some internal objects need entities for data-storage, but when programming they should use typed objects to not accidentally access invalid properties. EntityBasedWithLog A strongly typed object which gets its data from an entity, and also logs what it does. EntityRelationship Represents a Relation between two entities, connecting a parent to a child. Language Represents a Dimension / Language Assignment LazyEntities Delivers entities which are needed. It's lazy, because on initialization it only knows the Ids (int/guid) of the items to pick up, and only retrieves them when needed. Once retrieved, it will cache the result, until the up-stream reports changes. An additional optimization: in special cases where we just need the IDs for saving, it won't actually query the cache if the IDs are already known. Value<T> Represents a typed Value object in the memory model Zone Contains all the basic infos about a Zone - usually cached Interfaces IAttribute Represents an Attribute with Values - without knowing what data type is in the value. Usually we'll extend this and use IAttribute<T> instead. IAttribute<T> Represents an Attribute (Property), but strongly typed IAttributeBase Represents properties we should know about Attributes. This is the base for both IContentTypeAttribute (in the IContentType) attribute with values-list (in the IEntity) IContentType Represents a Content Type information (the schema) used for IEntity objects. IContentTypeAttribute Represents an Attribute definition in a ContentType. This is the base for attributes in IContentType IDimension Represents a Dimension to assign values to. Dimensions are usually languages ( ILanguage ), but in future they could also be multi-dimensional, like values which are mapped to a language and to a specific edition, use case, etc. IEntitiesSource This marks something which can give a list of entities. Usually used for lazy-loading data, where the source is attached, but the data isn't loaded yet. IEntity The primary data-item in the system, IEntity is a generic data-item for any kind of information. Note that it inherits IEntityLight which is the basic definition without languages, versioning, publishing etc. We recommend you read about the EAV Core Data Models IEntityBasedType Foundation for interfaces which will enhance EntityBasedType which gets its data from an Entity. This is used for more type safety - so you base your interfaces - like IPerson on this, otherwise you're IPerson would be missing the Title, Id, Guid IEntityLight Represents a light Entity, which is a very basic entity without multi-language capabilities, versions or publishing. For the more powerful Entity, use IEntity . ILanguage Represents a Language Dimension. It's identical to an IDimension for now. IRelationshipManager Manages relationships of an entity - to it's children and parents. IValue Represents a Value in the EAV system. Values belong to an attribute and can belong to multiple languages. IValue<T> Represents a Value with a specific type (string, decimal, etc.). Enums ValueTypes Attribute Type Enum"

It will pass on the first stream which has results. The order of evaluation is based on the names of the streams as they enter the StreamFallback. How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like: The above example shows a query from the blog app : a stream-fallback with 4 in-streams the first stream which would filter by tag, if the URL had a tag in it - as the test-data has no tag, this stream delivers no results the second stream filters by author - as the url would have an author (specified in the test-values), it does return items The StreamFallback therefor passes on the items provided by the author-filter. Note that while using the visual query, all other streams are also processed to show what's happening. At runtime it will stop processing other streams once it's found a first match. Programming With The StreamFallback DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

It can be overriden to change/configure what data is delivered to the template or search-index. How to use In your razor page (.cshtml file) you can add a script block implementing this, as follows: @functions{ // Prepare the data - get all categories through the pipeline public override void CustomizeData() { // new features in 6.1 - the App DataSource CreateSource<App> and also the RelationshipFilter // Just add the items which have the relationship to the category in the URL var qsOfCat = CreateSource<RelationshipFilter>(App.Data[\"QandA\"]); qsOfCat.Relationship = \"Categories\"; qsOfCat.Filter = \"[QueryString:Category]\"; Data.In.Add(\"QandA\", qsOfCat[\"Default\"]); } } Since the code above is run before the rest of the template is executed, the Data object now has a stream called QandA which the rest of the template can access using Data[\"QandA\"] . Notes and Clarifications In general, you can override this event to prepare data. It has a few benefits like It's always called, even if the data is not templated - for example when it's streamed as JSON or when it's prepared for search indexing In the future, most data-preparations will be possible through a visual designer, but for now, this is the best way to go.

    "keywords": "Optimizing Template Assets / Client Depedencies (JS & CSS) Purpose / Description This page is about using DNN Client-Resource-Management aka DNN Client-Depedency-Management in 2sxc templates. Whenever a template needs additional files, specifically JavaScripts CSS Styles Image Resources Fonts These should be included in an optimized form to enhance performance dramatically. This is all about reducing the amount of server requests (very important for end-user performance) and delivering them in the order / places in the HTML-file, optimal for their purpose. So far 2sxc will take care of your JS/CSS files by bundling and minifying them, at the position and order you need. How to use Here's a trivial example for optimizing a CSS with default settings: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/style.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\" /> Here's a more typical example, showing an optimization for a style & js which are inside the app-folder. This example uses Razor, so we use @App.Path to ensure it's picking up the right folder (use [App:Path] in token-templates): <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/style.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"150\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/lazy.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"bottom\" /> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"@App.Path/assets/scripts.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"200:bottom\" /> </script> This shows: a CSS with lower priority (150 instead of the default 100) a css with which will be placed at the page bottom (so it will load later) a script-tag and specifies priority and placement inside the HTML document How it works Basically all <script> tags and all <link rel=\"stylesheet\"> tags can have a data-enableoptimizations attribute, which the system will parse according to the environments capabilities. In DNN 7/8/9 this means it can can assign priorities (to ensure load-order) can assign placement in the html-document (head, body, bottom) Understanding Priorities There is a fairly complicated article in the dnn wiki about client resource management which explains most of it. In general you can say that all DNN scripts load with priorities below 100, the default for all standard scripts is 100, and from there you can order things as you need them. We usually prioritize libraries like 2sxc or angular.min.js with 100 or larger, and then place our own script (like an app-blog.min.js) at numbers like 200. Understanding Placement Placement information can only be supplied in 2sxc 8.9 or higher. The three positions are: head meaning that the resulting data is requested in the HTML header. So it will be loaded before the page is rendered, meaning it's available right from the start but also delays page-build. This is often detrimental in terms of page-load times. this is the default location for CSS files body meaning it will be loaded in the beginning of the HTML body tag. Again this means it's there very early, but will slow down page buildup. this is the default location for JS files bottom meaning it will be loaded at the end of the html document. This is actually great for page-loading performance to improve above-the-fold loading. But it takes a bit of work to perfect its application.

It lets you use data from SQL databases as if they were entities. How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query you can just drag it into your query. The Default out will contain the items from the DB: We recommend that you rename it so you know what it's for: You can then configure your connection to the DB and Query as you need it: Understanding the Settings Title & Notes This is just for your notes, to remind you what this is for and to put notes about anything you wanted to remember. Connection There are two ways to connect to SQL databases: using a Connection Name (which points to a detailed connection string in the web.config ) or using a detailed Connection String as you need it. We recommend to use connection names where possible. If you provide both, the connection name will be used: The SQL-Query The Query section has quite a lot of options, most of which are not required but are important for this to work: Here's what you need to know Content Type all entities must have a type-name - so you can just enter something here - in most cases the exact name isn't important, because you usually don't refer back to this, unless further processing will try to filter this or something EntityId and EntityTitle when using entities in 2sxc / EAV, each entity must be able to supply a title and an ID which is an integer. This is important for internal data processing to work. For this to work with SQL, the source needs to know what data-fields to use for this. By default it will use a field called EntityId and EntityTitle , but you can also use any other field - in which case you must supply the names in the following fields. Using URL Parameters in Queries The SQL DataSource can also use queries which use URL Parameters. It's safe and automatically prevent SQL Injection. For example, you can do the following: SELECT TOP (1000) PortalId as EntityId, HomeDirectory as EntityTitle,PortalID,ExpiryDate, AdministratorRoleId,GUID,HomeDirectory, CreatedOnDate,PortalGroupID FROM [Portals] Where PortalId = [QueryString:Id] This will automatically use the id parameter from the URL to filter the result. Using Another Entity As SQL Parameter You can of course use the In stream to provide entities which configure the SQL. The following example has a content-type SqlSetting with only one item (to make the example easier to understand). The App DataSource delivers this in the AppSetting stream, which also goes into the Sql as AppSetting and is then used as a token in the SQL: Using A Value from a Module-Instance as SQL Parameter This works like in the App-example: Provide the data from the ModuleDataSource as an In stream to the SqlDataSource, and use that to filter: Programming With The SqlDataSource DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization. An example code @{ var sql = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource>(); sql.ConnectionString = \"SiteSqlServer\"; // use DNN sql.SelectCommand = \"Select ... From\"; // your sql here } @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(sql[\"Default\"])) { <div>@post.EntityTitle</div> } Important When Coding Note that data sources only retrieve data once, and then ignore any further configuration.

When using content-items in Razor-Templates and WebAPIs you usually don't care about this, as you will use it as a [IDynamicEntity][Dynamic Entity]. But there are some advanced cases where you need to look deeper into the object - maybe to check if a translation exists in another language, or if the value is blank because it's null, or an empty string. In this case you'll need to look at the internals, the IEntity . Difference IEntity and IDynamicEntity Just a short piece of code, so you can see why you usually don't want to use the IEntity and will prefer the IDynamicEntity instead. // the common way, using the content-item as a DynamicEntity var titleSimple = Content.Title; // a bit harder, what actually happens internally var languagePreference = [\"de\", \"en\"]; var autoResolveLinks = true; var titleMedium = AsEntity(Content).GetBestValue(\"Title\", languagePreference, autoResolveLinks); // hard-core, the internals IEntity entity = AsEntity(Content); Dictionary<string, IAttribute> attribs = entity.Attributes; IAttribute titleMultiLanguage = attribs[\"Title\"]; string attType = titleMultiLanguage.Type; IEnumerable<IValue> titleVals = titleMultiLanguage.Values; IValue firstTitle = titleVals.First(); string firstString = firstTitle.ToString(); IEnumerable<ILanguage> langAssignments = firstTitle.Languages; //etc. As you can see, the internals provide a lot of information about the underlying data - things you usually don't care about, but in rare cases may be important. How to use Note that this is a very advanced topic, and you'll need Visual Studio Intellisense to get this done reasonably. Since you'll figure it out fairly quickly, we won't document it in detail here. What you need to know is: // assume that you have a DynamicEntity like Content var entity = AsEntity(Content); // assume that you have a DataStream with Entities... @foreach(var postEntity in Data[\"Default\"]) { var postDyn = AsDynamic(postEntity); // postEntity is a IEntity // postDyn is a DynamicEntity } // but this is easier - convert the whole list @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"])) { var postEnt = AsEntity(post); // do something with the @post here, it's a DynamicEntity // ...or with postEnt, it's an IEntity } Read also To dive deeper, you must check the EAV Server Code History Introduced in 2sxc 01.00 Multi-Language since 2sxc 02.00 Added Value and Value<T> , PrimaryValue<T> as well as Parents() and Children(...) in 09.42.

    "title": "How to Use a Dynamic Entity | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "How to Use a Dynamic Entity Whenever you create a content-type - like Person - and want to work with the data in your C# Razor templates, you'll be working with a Dynamic Entity . Code example using a Dynamic Entity We'll assume we have a Content Type called Book with the following properties: Title (text, 1-line) Teaser (text, multi-line) Description (text, html) ReleaseDate (date) Author (entity - another content item) Here's a code example in a C# Razor template: <!-- The default variable for the current item is Content, we'll just use another name for this sample note that .Title is automatically provided, because the content-type has the property title. --> <h1>@Content.Title</h1> <div>@Content.Description</div> <div>Author: @Content.Author[0].FullName</div> So basically all properties of this book can be shown using [Object].[PropertyName] - for example Content.ReleaseDate . What Dynamic Entity really does - and how... Technically the dynamic entity object is like a read-helper for the more complex IEntity . So actually the dynamic entity object will keep a reference to the underlying read-only IEntity item on a property Entity , and whenever your code accesses a property, the dynamic entity will query it from the underlying Entity . The main things that the dynamic entity does for you, are Give you a nice, short syntax to access a property - so Content.FirstName instead of Object.Attributes[\"FirstName\"][\"en\"] which would be necessary using the more advanced IEntity object Ensure that the language used in retrieving a value is the current user language Give conveniant access to related information like the Presentation object Automatically handle some data-not-found errors Automatically do conversions, like convert related entities (like .Children ) into dynamic objects to make your code more consistant Properties of a Dynamic Entity Read the API docs in the @ToSic.Sxc.Interfaces.IDynamicEntity. Additional properties that work (they are dynamic, so don't appear in the code) EntityType string - the type name like Person IsPublished bool - true/false if this item is currently published AnyProperty dynamic, but actually bool | string | decimal | datetime | List any normal property of the content-item can be accessd directly. It's correctly .net typed (string, etc.) The following Methods exist on all dynamic entities Render() - will render HTML for the current item, if there is a configuration for this. Almost always returns a simple HTML-comment, unless used as inner-content (added in 2sxc 8.3) Working with unpublished/draft items TODO: write something about how-to-check if published/unpublished, navigating it, etc. - or link to such a page Appendix The following properties/methods exist, but shouldn't be used. They are documented here so that you know that they are not meant for public use: Created - the created date Author - the person who created this item Owner - the current owner of the item, usually the author Metadadata - currently use AsEntity(theObject).Metadata Permissions - permissions of the current item (if any are defined) History Introduced in 2sxc 01.00 Changed to use interface IDynamicEntity in 6.x Draft/Published introduced in 2sxc 7.x Presentation introduced in 2sxc 7.x Modified introduced in 2sxc 8.x Implemented .net equality comparer in 2sxc 9.42 Parents added in 2sxc 9.42 Get added in 2sxc 9.42 and added to interface IDynamicEntity in 10.07 Parents introduced in 2sxc 9.42, and added to interface IDynamicEntity in 10.07 IsDemoItem property added in 2sxc 10.06"

That allows us to improve the architecture without worrying about breaking your code. Once we're really sure that certain parts are very final, we'll publish the API docs for those parts. What You're Probably Looking for APIs in Razor Templates and WebApi If you are creating a Razor template and want to know what APIs are available, start with IRazor which is mostly an IDynamicCode with an IHtmlHelper . This is because a Razor Page inherits from that interface, so you'll see all the commannds you get there. If you're creating a WebApi and need to know everything in it, you also want to check the IDynamicWebApi , because all WebApi classes implement that interface. Working with Entities and ADAM Assets If you're working with DynamicEntity objects and want to know more about them, check out IDynamicEntity . In very rare cases you also want to know more about the underlying IEntity . If you're working with ADAM Assets, like from the AsAdam(...) command on IDynamicEntity objects, you'll want to read about @ToSic.Sxc.Adam.IAdamFolder and @ToSic.Sxc.Adam.IAdamFile Programming with DataSources and VisualQuery All the DataSources are based on IDataSource and most of them are also IDataTarget .

    "keywords": "Class RelationshipFilter Filter Entities by Value in a Related Entity. For example: Find all Books (desired Entity), whose Authors (related Entity) have a Country (Attribute) with 'Switzerland' (Value). Data Source: RelationshipFilter Purpose / Description The RelationshipFilter DataSource is part of the Standard EAV Data Sources . It will return only the items which have a relationship to another item - like books having an author, or blog-posts with the tag grunt . How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like: Using Url Parameters You can of course also use URL parameters for both the value as well as the field: Using the Fallback In case none of the items match the reqiurement, then either no items are returned, or those in the fallback stream: You can find more fallback examples like chaining them in the ValueFilter DataSource Separators for Multiple Criterias (2sxc 9.9+) Until 2sxc 9.8 you could only check for 1 related item, so you could only say \"give me all items which have this one author\". In 2sxc 9.9 we are now able to specify multiple authors, allowing queries like \"give me all items which have all these authors\" or \"give me all items which have any of these authors\". This works using the separation-character, which is usually a comma , but could be something different (in case your items have commas in the texts you're comparing). If you don't specify a separator, none will be used and the whole Filter criteria is treated as one value. Here's where you set it: All Operators (2sxc 9.9+) Untill 2sxc 9.8, you could not specify an operator, and contains was the assumed operator. In 9.9 we added a lot more. To explain what each does, assume that our main stream contains items of BlogPost and we only want to keep the posts having certain Tags . Here's the list, each is explained more below: contains - will return all items (BlogPosts), having all the children (tags) specified containsany - will return all items (BlogPosts) having any of the children (tags) specified not-contains will return all items (BlogPosts) not-having-all of the children (tags). So it will also return those items, having some of the children. not-containsany will return all items (BlogPosts) having none of the children (tags) specified. any will return all items (BlogPosts) having any children at all (tags). So the filter is ignored. This is the same as count=0. not-any will return all items (BlogPosts) having no children (tags). first will return all items (BlogPosts) where the first child (tag) is one of the filter-options. This is for scenarios where you say the first tag is a primary-category or similar. not-first will return all items (BlogPosts) where the first children (tags) is not one of the filter values. count will return all items (BlogPosts) having a specific amount of children (tags) not-count will return all items (BlogPosts) not having a specific amount of children (tags) Filtering On Fields other than Title and ID (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to specify which field you want to compare (before it was always Id or Title). Here's an example: Filtering by Relationship-Count (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by amount of relationships - so you could say \"give me all blog-posts with exactly 2 tags\": Note: you can also reverse this, so instead of count you can use not-count to get all the items that don't match this requirement. Filtering by Has-Any (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by Limitations of the RelationshipFilter Note that as of now (2sxc 9.9) the RelationshipFilter: can only seek child-items Programming With The RelationshipFilter DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

    "keywords": "Namespace ToSic.Eav.DataSources Purpose / Description DataSources are objects which deliver one or many DataStreams , which contain a bunch of content-items. They are then attached to each other (from one sources Out to another ones In ) creating a Query . Queries can be customized at will. The whole system is used to prepare/process data for views, WebApi or anything else. Overview There are many data-sources, and most of them will... ...either get data from somewhere external like SQL, CSV, REST or the EAV-cache and provide this for further use - then it's a pure IDataSource ...or receive data from another DataSource, then process/filter this and provide the result for further use, in which case it's both an IDataSource as well as an IDataTarget So DataSources can be joined together into a Query to do amazing things, like a CsvDataSource can read a CSV-file and provide the data as a stream on Entities on csvDs[\"Default\"] ... ...and pipe the result it to a CacheDataSource which caches the data for x-minutes ...then pipe it to a ValueFilterDataSource , which only shows the items where the Country matches the Url-parameters country ...then pipe it to a ValueSortDataSource, ordering it by LastName and then FirstName ...then pipe it to another CacheDataSource so that this common filter/sort combination will be kept for 5 minutes and then the result can be used in a Template or streamed as JSON to a JavaScript SPA. Understanding Data-Flow between DataSource Objects Each DataSource has a list of out-streams available on the .Out[\"StreamName\"] property, but usually access directly just with the DataSourceName[\"StreamName\"] . This is what also happens when you use the Data object and write foreach(var item in Data[\"Default\"]) . Aside from consuming data in your your template, most data-sources will simply offer the Out-Stream to other DataSources for further processing. Technically it's mapped like this: Cache.Out[\"Default\"] > ContentTypeFilter.In[\"Default\"] ... then some magic happens inside the ContentTypeFilter ... then the ContentTypeFilter.Out[\"Default\"] has the resulting items, which can again be used as an In on another DataSource, or simply used in your template Most DataSources will only have one In-stream and one Out-stream, but this is very variable depending on your need. In most cases there will be a VisualQuery which connects all the parts automatically, but when you want to work with them programatically, here you'll find the API. Note that we've hidden the constructors for all DataSource objects in these docs, because you should usually use the CreateSource<T>(...) command on the Razor template or WebApi, which will auto-configure things behind the scenes. IDataSource / DataSource in .net code Creating your own Custom DataSource short instruction to get started here's docs about the relevant API understanding configuration injection Understanding Configuration of Each DataSource Object The configuration uses a sophisticated token system to provide all necessary information. It is explained here . Common Use Cases of DataSource in C# Code You will usually use DataSource objects in these common cases: when templating in Razor, the Data object is a DataSource, usually having a Default stream ( Data[\"Default\"] ) and sometimes further streams like Data[\"ListContent\"] or Data[\"Categories\"] etc. when templating, the App.Data is also a DataSource providing a stream for each content-type in this app, like App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] or App.Data[\"Tag\"] every query is technically a DataSource, and in the query you define which DataStreams it has - if ever you use it in code, you'll see that App.Query[\"SortedTags\"] would be a DataSource and typically the Default stream would contain all these tags. a query is always a chain of DataSource doing one operation and passing it on to the next DataSource. How to use In your Razor-templates you'll usually work with these three sources: Data App.Data App.Query[...] Please read more about these in links. Creating DataSource Objects in C#/Razor Code Sometimes you want to have full control over what a DataSource does or what parameters it's using. This is easy: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Authors\"; // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors[\"Default\"]; Creating a Query in Code by Piping / Chaining Data sources What the visual-designer does is configure how DataSources are attached, mapping their in/out streams and adding parameters. You can also do this in code, but it's fairly advanced. You would usually want to do this, if you want to use a filter or something, but need to provide parameters which aren't available in the Visual Query Designer. Here's a simple example: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Author\"; // Sort by FullName var sortedAuthors = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthors.Attributes = \"FullName\"; // Sort by Fullname descending var sortedAuthorsDesc = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsDesc.Attributes = \"FullName\"; sortedAuthorsDesc.Directions = \"desc\"; // Sort by 2 fields var sortedAuthorsMult = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsMult.Attributes = \"Website,FullName\"; sortedAuthorsMult.Directions = \"asc, desc\"; // sort by internal EntityId var sortedAuthorsById = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsById.Attributes = \"EntityId\"; Because the first allAuthors didn't specify an up-stream in the () empty brackes, it automatically gets attached to the App-Cache with all the data of the current app. So var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); will initially have all content-items at it's disposal. The most important thing to notice is that each additional data-source uses the first allAuthors DataSource as the default upstream DataSource. So when these sort/filter or do something, they will only receive the data already filtered by the allAuthors. Developing Your Own DataSource Maybe you want to create an XML DataSource or a DNN-Users DataSource. This is easy to do. Best read the blog post about this Read also about Data Streams Demo-App showing some coding of DataSources Blog about creating your own data-source History Introduced in 2sxc 04.00 Classes App Represents an App with all the data inside it. For example, it has a variable amount of Out-streams, one for each content-type in the app. AttributeFilter DataSource to only pass through configured AttributeNames - other attributes/properties are removed from the entities. BaseDataSource The base class, which should always be inherited. Already implements things like Get One / Get many, Caching and a lot more. CsvDataSource DataSource for importing/reading CSV files. DataTableDataSource Provide Entities from a System.Data.DataTable. This is not meant for VisualQuery, but for code which pre-processes data in a DataTable and then wants to provide it as entities. EntityIdFilter A DataSource that filters Entities by Ids EntityTypeFilter Return only entities of a specific content-type ExternalDataDataSource Base DataSource class for providing data from external systems ItemFilterDuplicates A DataSource that merges two streams OwnerFilter Filter entities to show Drafts or only Published Entities Paging A DataSource that filters Entities by Ids PassThrough A DataSource that passes through all In Connections.

PublishingFilter Filter entities to show Drafts or only Published Entities RelationshipFilter Filter Entities by Value in a Related Entity.

Shuffle A DataSource that filters Entities by Ids SqlDataSource Provide Entities from a SQL Server StreamFallback A DataSource that returns the first stream which has content StreamMerge A DataSource that merges two streams ValueFilter Return only Entities having a specific value in an Attribute ValueSort Sort Entity by values in specified Attributes Interfaces IDataSource Public interface for an Eav DataSource. All DataSource objects are based on this. IDataStream Represents a DataStream object. This is a stream of IEntity objects, which has a source and a name. A stream can be read from, and it can be attached to upstream data-sources for further processing. IDataTarget Represents a data source that can be the recipient of Data. This basically means it has an In IDataStream"

This is where it resides - usually you don't want to know about it ;). If you do, here a short conceptual background: Any object can have a property - usually called Log which is an ILog . Using this the object can call the Log.Add(...) to add messages. Many other commands help in various scenarios. The real power comes from chaining these - because each logger can know what parent-logger it reports to. This allows us to reproduce the chain of events in the original code, because you can track where loggers were made, and how they relate. Most objects which use the Log, implement the IHasLog , often by inheriting HasLog which automates things when initializing - like the chaining of the Loggers. Classes HasLog Base class for most objects which simply want to implement log and log-chaining. Interfaces IHasLog Objects which can log their activity, and share their log with other objects in the chain to produce extensive internal logging. ILog A logger with special capabilities.

    "keywords": "DataSource API Purpose / Description DataSources are a magic, generic system which can generate new data-items or filter / modify other data. This section explains how they work and the API you need to create your own. Basics DataSources have a few important concepts you must first understand: An item is a data-object of the type IEntity - it can be a person, product, file-informatio etc. A list of items is is a List<IEntity> which contains zero, one or many items A stream is an object which has list of items, and a name A correctly built stream will offer this list, but only build it if it's actually requested Each DataSource has one or many named Out streams Each DataSource can have one or more named In streams coming from other DataSources Each DataSource has a ConfigurationProvider , which gives the DataSource information about the environment (like Portal or Tab information), App-Settings and more Each DataSource can have custom Settings , which the user entered in a dialog. Internally this is also an IEntity object DataSources also have cache-identity mechanism, to inform any up-stream cache what parameters actually caused this result, so that the data could be cached if needed Providing Data To offer data on the Out you will usually use the Provide method. If you're generating new items, you'll usually use the AsEntity method. Docs for these: DataSource.Provide DataSource.AsEntity Receiving Data from In for further processing if your DataSource performs filtering or similar actions on existing data, then this data comes in on the In streams. In such scenarios, you would simply iterate over the In[streamname].List and provide the result in your out-stream again. You can find many examples in the EAV DataSources code. Getting Configuration A DataSource gets the configuration from a configuration provider. To better understand this, you should read: about configuration about tokens ConfigMask(...) . Configuring the UI There is a special attribute called VisualQuery to tell the UI how to show your DataSource and provide help etc. VisualQuery attribute History Introduced in 2sxc 4 or 5 enhanced / simplified in 2sxc 9.13"

    "title": "DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens DataSource objects have an sophisticated system to retrieve settings and configuration using tokens and more. Purpose / Description A DataSource is usually configurable, meaning that it needs parameters to do it's job. Some examples: a Module data source needs to know the module ID an Owner-Filter DataSource needs to know who the current user is, to find his items a Paging needs to know what page size it should use and what page it's on A CSV data source needs to know what file it should load As you can see, some of this information depends on the current context (ModuleId, UserId), others on configured settings (page size) and some on Url-parameters (Page number). In addition, we sometimes want to say \"use the page-size configured in the App-Settings\" or even more complex \"use from url, but if not specified, try app-settings, and if that isn't defined, use 10\" . This is what this Token-Configuration-Injection-System is for. Configuration Basics Each configuration of a DataSource is either a fixed string value like 17 or a token like [Settings:PageNumber] . In most cases it's a token. This token is parsed before any data is queried to ensure that in the end the DataSource has a usefull value before actually performing its task. Token Basics A token is a piece of text that looks like [Source:Property] . It is good to understand the full token concept, discussed here . You'll also want to read about fallback and recursion to understand the following content. Shared Token-Suppliers / Token-Sources When a DataSource is configured, it has many token-suppliers like Module , QueryString , App etc. These are shared and are identical for all objects. Advanced Token-Source for Settings The Settings source is a special source which contains all the properties of the settings-item which configures exactly this one data-source. For example the token [Settings:PageNumber] will deliver the number or text in the settings pagenumber field. Advanced Token-Source for In DataSources also have a source called In which is different for each DataSource, as each one has its own In-streams. You can use it in tokens like [In:Default:PageSize] where the term after In: is the stream-name to be consulted. How Tokens are Defined, Settings Edited and Resolved When you're using the visual query designer, the configuration created is saved as an Entity (aka Content-Item) which must be injected into the DataSource configuration automatically. But when you use the object is your code, your code must be able to provide other values. But how does this work? Each DataSource object has a property called Configuration which is a dictionary containing all configuration properties the data source will care about. For example, the EntityIdFilter has a Configuration with only one property which is called EntityIds . The each property is first initialized with a Token-Template. For example, the CsvDataSource has a ConfigMask(DelimiterKey, \"[Settings:Delimiter||\\t]\"); This says that the delimiter should come from the Settings-Entity field Delimiter and if not provided, fall back to \\t (which is a tab character) read about ConfigMask here For the programmer who wants to set a number or whatever, this would be fairly unreliable to access from outside, so the DataSource should also have a real property which internally also modifies the dictionary. For example, the CsvDataSource has a string-property Delimiter which internally will get/set the in the Configuration dictionary. When the DataSource is first sucked from, which happens when something tries to access the Out-Property, it will automatically run a token-engine to resolve the values, then run whatever action the data-source wants. read about ensuring configuration is parsed here So how does each scenario work out? If the programmer overwrote the Delimiter property, then internally the Configuration[\"Delimiter\"] is now not a token any more, but instead just a character like , . So the token-engine won't change anything. If the programmer didn't do anything but the visual query engine gave a settings-entity to the system, then the token is resolved and whatever the user entered is used. if the neither the programmer nor the user provided settings, then the token-engine will resolve to the fallback and use the \\t as was defined.

    "title": "JS: The $2sxc Manager | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "JS: The $2sxc Manager Purpose / Description The $2sxc-object is the core JavaScript object helping you to access data of your view or WebAPIs of your 2sxc-App. You need this in advanced use cases. otherwise you don't need this . Such advanced cases are: When you want to use view-data as an asyc-JS call if you wish to work with WebAPI REST calls if you want more control over the edit-experience with custom buttons etc. How to use add a script-tag to include the 2sxc.api.min.js note 1: in edit-mode this happens automatically note 2: always use lower-case paths and the minified version call the $2sxc(...) constructor to get a sxc-controller for your module (as each module on the page will have an own $2sxc controller) work with the API of the sxc-controller Here's a simple example of a template-file: <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/js/2sxc.api.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\"></script> <script> $(function () { var modId = 17; var sxc = $2sxc(modId); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }); </script> The code above shows how to include the api-file in the best way, minified and optimized (so it will be picked up by the client-dependency framework) how the sxc-object is resolved how to ask if we're in edit-mode The moduleId is usually dynamic, so you can't hardwire it with var modId = 17 into your JS code. This is explained in the next section Initialization . Initialization of the $2sxc for a Module We have three initializers: $2sxc(DomNode) - recommended $2sxc(moduleId) - oldest way, very common $2sxc(moduleId, contentBlockId) - a special version for internal use only The Recommended HTML/DOM-Node Initializer We recommend the DOM-Node syntax , because in that mode $2sxc will go up through the DOM-tree and find the module it's in (or the content-block), and auto-configure itself. What's nice about this is that this method works without any server-side support (which you need for the other methods). Here's a simple example: <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run(\"layout\")'>layout</a> In the above example, the dom-node is given by the current click, which puts the current <a> node in the this object. Here's a JS example: var x = $(\".myApp\"); // get ANY dom element inside this 2sxc app var sxc1 = $2sxc(x); // use it // the same thing in 1 line var sxc2 = $2sxc($(\"#SomeNodeInThePage\")); Note that the simple example above assumes that there is only one item on the page, but there can often be more. So you'll usually need to do something like this // note that we cannot work before the page-onready. // so our code is in a $(our-code); $(function(){ $(\"some-jquery-selector\").each(function(index, element){ var sxc = $2sxc(element); // now do something... }); }); The Classic ModuleId method In this method, you need to get the ModuleId from somewhere, usually provided by the server-side template. In a Token-Template you would use [Module:ModuleId] and in a Razor-Template it's @Dnn.Module.ModuleID (large \"ID\"). The previous code in Tokens would be like: $(function () { var sxc = $2sxc([Module:ModuleId]); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }) And the same code in Razor would be like: $(function () { var sxc = $2sxc(@Dnn.Module.ModuleID); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }) You can also find an example of finding all of our nodes and initializing them in the TimeLineJS App . If you're interested, here's the js-initializer . Everything about the Module-Level sxc Controller In the module sxc controller you'll read about: The API of a module-level controller Calling commands, creating toolbars and buttons Working with JSON data of the current module Working with REST / HTTP Async Stuff Working with WebAPI calls, especially to your backend WebAPI in your api-folder Calling Queries (from the visual query designer) Technical Features Explained Including the $2sxc API JavaScript File Each template that needs the $2sxc-file when not logged in must include it, to be sure it's always there when needed. Note that we've included various features to prevent duplicate execution. if the file is included multiple times, it will only execute once if the file is included minified and unminified, it too will only be executed once if you need to debug the JS for whatever reason with F12 in the browser a sourcemap is included for more advanced debuging, just include the unminified version Note that the entire code is packed in an IIFE, so the only global variable created is the $2sxc . Everything is Cached We optimized for just about every thinkable situation, so the $2sxc will build a controller-object for a module, but following calls to it will use the cached information. Example: var sxc = $2sxc(42); // initial call, will build controller for Module 42 var sxc2 = $2sxc(42); // second call, will use cached controller var sxc3 = $2sxc(domNodeInsideTheModule42); // another call, will also used cached controller Metadata Needed by $2sxc to Work The $2sxc object needs a few pieces of information to work properly, which are stored in a JSON in the HTML. So the Module-DIV-Tag is actually enhanced with additional pieces of information. This structure is open and easy to read, but the structure can change from time to time, so don't read/rely on that JSON, use the $2sxc to access any information. There are even situations where additional metadata in inserted into the HTML rendered by your template. This has to do with inner-content (see next section) and the same \"don't rely on the JSON\" applies. Module-Instances and Content-Blocks This is a very advanced topic, so if you're new - just skip this. Also if you use content-blocks you don't need to understand this, it's just included for completeness. A 2sxc-module can contain many 2sxc-content-blocks since version 8.4 because an item could have independent, inner content-blocks. Because of this, the controller may need an additional parameter, so instead of $2sxc(moduleId) it can also use $2sxc(moduleId, contentBlockId) . As mentioned above, you never need to work with this, it's included for completeness. Since the now recommended method to initialized $2sxc is not with the moduleId but with a DOM-node, that call will automatically resolve everything correctly. Additional properties of the $2sxc Controller In 2sxc 9.30 a new object $2sxc.cms was added - read about it in $2sxc.cms TODO: document the properties, mention that they won't be stable in future versions Till we find time to document more, please consult the ( https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-ui/blob/master/src/js-api/2sxc.api/2sxc.api.js)(https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-ui/blob/master/src/js-api/2sxc.api/2sxc.api.js ) Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App TimeLineJS all the JS-apps including AngularJS in the app-catalog More links: Description of the feature on 2sxc docs History Introduced in 2sxc 04.00 Enhanced with cms (see cms ) in 9.30"

This brief manual should help you setup the parts you want to work on, or everything. Important: If you only want to work with 2sxc / EAV, then you do NOT need this . This is meant for people who want to contribute to the source code of 2sxc and EAV. Pre-Requisites Visual Studio 2015 MSBuild Community Tasks 1.4 or newer (required for automatic module packaging if you want to create dnn-module packages of 2sxc to distribute to another dnn) https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks or chec https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=19372 We also use grunt, gulp and bower so if you want to do some JS you'll also need to install NPM, Gulp and Bower (grunt will auto-install as a dependency) Recommendations: SQL Server 2014, but it also works on older versions like 2008 Basics The full solution pulls together many projects, some responsible for server-code, some for UI, some for in-page JS and some just containing translations. We separated these to make it easier to contribute to a specific part without worrying about the rest. If you only want to contribute to something small - like the languages / translations - then you only need to download that repository. In the complex scenarios each project can build into the other target, so if you want to work full-stack and use all of the automation, you will want to put everything in C:\\Projects\\ . Example when helping with translations The github repo for translations is https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-eav-languages with the command line, go to C:\\Projects\\ (of course you may want to create that folder first) clone the github repo with git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-eav-languages - this will create a folder for you called C:\\Projects\\2sxc-eav-languages containing all the languages work in that project commit back Note: as you probably won't have write permissions on the main language repo, you probably can't commit back. The correct procedure then is to fork the main repo into yours, and push into your own online repo. Then start a pull request, which we can then process. Full Scale Setup The full-scale setup is meant for people, who want to work with all the pieces. As of now (December 2017) you should clone all these projects into the following folders: Start by Installing your DNN Installing DNN Please install a DNN - ideally a 7.4.2 version or similar so you wont use APIs which don't exist in that version in the path above. Steps are approx. like this: Recommended: using NVQuickSite you can easily install DNN 7.4.2 in the C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website folder. This exact folder is important, because other parts (like js projects) will copy their builds into this folder The domain isn't important, but we recommend 2sxc-dnn742.dnndev.me Manual: Download the minimal DNN version that 2sxc supports and extract it to C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website (the exact folder is important, because the grunt/gulp tasks refer to this path) Configure the website in IIS (use binding 2sxc.dev) Use a default ASP.NET 4 / 4.5 application pool with Network Service account Add entry to local hosts file: 127.0.0.1 2sxc-dnn742.dnndev.me (could also be different, but this is our recommendation) Setup an empty database in SQL Management Studio Start the website and configure DNN to use the previously created database Installing 2sxc as Code in the DNN Then install 2sxc as a normal installable module (to get all the tables etc. setup) Now you must replace the installed 2sxc with the source-code version, linked to Github. /DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent folder again (required because we clone the git repository there) Use Visual Studio, Git or SourceTree to clone the 2sxc repository at https://github.com/2sic/2sxc to the empty folder ToSIC_SexyContent - eg. in /DesktopModules/ type git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc ToSic_SexyContent also run bower install and npm install in the folder (using command-line or visual studio) Note: don't open the 2sxc-solution yet in visual studio - you need to later open the full package which includes the EAV with 2sxc, otherwise project references get \"fixed\" in a wrong way Installing the additional git repositories in a command line, go to c:\\Projects\\ run git clone https://github.com/2sic/eav-server - the EAV server system run git clone https://github.com/2sic/eav-ui - the EAV UI (javascript dialogs, etc.) run git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-ui - the 2sxc / DNN UIs run git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-eav-languages - the languages run git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-icons - our custom icon-fonts for all of these you may need to run npm install and/or bower install GIT Branches We use the git-flow convention , and you should familiarize yourself with this, to properly work with the branches. As of now, the development-branch is called dev but we'll rename it to develop within the next few days. The EAV / 2sxc Server Solution Basically if you open the solution in the eav-server folder, it will open all the EAV server (C#) code and 2sxc code in Visual Studio. This is very important, because if you build anything extensive and rename anything, it guarantees that everything is correctly updated. The EAV-UI This is a lot of JS, which when you build it using gulp develop , it will collect / build it all, and auto-copy to the 2sxc-folders. The 2sxc UI This extends the EAV-UI with more field types, adds configuration and also adds a lot of other JS. if you run the gulp develop it too will auto-build and copy to the live DNN / 2sxc site. The Importance of the right Folders The current setup places the EAV project and the 2sxc-project in exactly defined folders. This helps that when we build the EAV or make changes to it, that it will auto-copy everything in the build-process to the 2sxc bin and dist. So this isn't required, but if you want to do some serious stuff it will save you time to copy/deploy the dependencies over and over. The 2sxc dnn should run in c:\\projects\\2SexyContent\\Web WIP (Work In Progress) At the moment not important yet, but some new features we're working on are in these Repos: git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-inpage git clone https://github.com/2sic/eav-item-dialog-angular"

The git repository is called https://github.com/2sic/2sxc.wiki.git Right now I'm using Visual Studio Code to edit this, and I must say I like the fact that I can make many changes and commit in one go, + the instant preview while typing is really nice: Working with images and asset-files Adding images is very difficult when editing online (there's no upload feature) but it's very easy when editing offline, because you can create folders and push them back. Please use the following structure for now assets (contains all the assets) logos (contains various logos, for re-use) contribute (assets for the page Contribute ) [page-name] (assets for each specific page) If you have any other image/file needs which need different structure, please discuss with Daniel @iJungleboy. About the Markdown Syntax If you're new to wikis or github comments / documentation, you may be a bit lost when it comes to markdown. I think the most important things you need to know are: Headers have 1-6 hashes in front, like ## Header 2 bold uses two * chars around the text, _italic_ uses one _ char, escaping chars uses the \\ slash (so any character right after a \\ is shown and doesn't format) Linking has many options, better read the manuals Lists have many options, better read the manuals Images use a ![alt-text](/assets/path/file.ext) syntax Note that line-breaks usually don't cause a line-break in the result (except in code-samples). You can enforce a simple line break by adding two spaces at the end of a line like \"check out: \" (two spaces after the \":\") Inline code starts and ends with a \"`\" character - like `code` - it will then look like code Multi-line code blocks start with three of these, like ``` var x = 17; // a comment ``` resulting in var x = 17; // a comment Multi-line code with syntax highlighting needs you to specifiy the language c#: ```c# var x = 17; // a comment ``` resulting in var x = 17; // a comment Copyright All docs are licensed as CC-BY .

    "keywords": "Concept: Polymorph / Editions / Open-Heart-Surgery (WIP) Imagine you have a running system and you want to make some changes on the live installation. During the time you work, you would always risk breaking the site, but we usually don't have the time to create a staging environment. Enter Polymorphism. Note that this is not a complete solution yet. We're working on this and have parts of it working, and will add functionality step-by-step. Let's compare the perfect multi-edition (polymorph) setup to the classic solution: Progress As of now (2sxc 9.35) we have achieved the first step, allowing the WebAPI controllers to be polymorph. So this is the current state of development: This means that: Api Controllers are already fully polymorph. They can be placed in a subfolder like [app-root]/live/api/WtfController.cs and can be accessed using a url with the edition in the name, allowing multiple identically named controllers to be used. Views are polymorph if you do the view selection manually. This means, you can place your views in a subfolder like [app-root]/live/list.cshtml and then have an entry-point [app-root]/list.cshtml which will choose which edition to use - then using @RenderPage to pick that edition. This is still manual, because we're not sure yet what the perfect implementation is, so we would rather wait before standardizing a bad solution. Everything that is data (schemas, items, queries, settings and resources) is still one edition only. The data model is able to perform multi-edition content-management, but we're not ready yet to provide the UIs etc. for this, as it could lead to confusion, so we'll hold back on this for now. How to use WebApi Polymorph (2sxc 9.35+) As of now, to use the WebApi Polymorp, this is what you would do: instead of placing your WtfController.cs in the [app-root]/api/ folder, you place it in a [app-root]/live/api folder. the live, default JS would then access it using [dnn-api-root]/app/auto/live/api/Wtf You can then copy this controller to [app-root]/dev/api and make your changes there. In your JS, you would then (while testing/developing) access this edition using [dnn-api-root]/app/auto/dev/api/Wtf without causing problems on the live solution, as all other users are still accessing the live edition, while you're working on the dev edition. Once everything works, deploy (copy) the now modified WtfController.cs from the dev/api folder to live/api and all users benefit from the changes. How to use Views Polymorph (manually) As mentioned above, this isn't automated yet, but the vision is clear, and it works ca. like this: place your real views - let's say list.cshtml not in the [app-root]/list.cshtml but in an edition folder - like [app-root]/live/list.cshtml . In the root, also create a [app-root]/list.cshtml , but this will basically just render the file from the editions folder, using @RenderPage(\"live/list.cshtml\") Now, determine how you want to switch between editions - for example based on a cookie value or host-user. Add this logic to the [app-root]/list.cshtml to determine the edition you want to use, and based on this if()...else()... to render either the live/list.cshtml or dev/list.cshtml Now you can work on the dev/list.cshtml without affecting live users. Once it's ready, deploy (copy) the dev/list.cshtml to live/list.cshtml Next Development Steps Next in line, we want to standardize a few things, like: Providing a UI or something to move/deploy one edition to another, so that you can work in staging, and then use a UI or something to deploy your work to live. This should also auto-backup what was in live before, in case you want to roll back. Standardize how a to automatically determine which \"morph\" a user is in and how to set the user to this morph, making it easier to use and removing the requirement for \"switcher-views\" which determine which real view to show. For now, Data-Polymorphism is low priority, because we're not sure yet if we can \"pull this off\" in a way that won't confuse the users.

It has the version 2017 so that you can reference it as your standard, and if larger recommendation changes are made or if the standard grows, we'll create a new standard. This is the current version How to use This style guide is built according to our role-model the Angular 2 style guide by John Papa . This style guide presents our preferred conventions and, as importantly, explains why. Table Of Contents General Principles Solution Architecture File Structure Content Types Fields Using Items as Content or Data Working with Presentation and Demo-Data Templates in General Token Templates Razor Templates JavaScript Templates Querying Data General Principles Use Visual Studio Code Style 01.11 + Consider use Visual Studio Code and your preferred code editor diff ? Why it's the most agile, best aligned code-editor for modern solutions on the MS-stack it's great for editing all kinds of modern file formats incl. HTML, Razor, Markdown, etc. it's great for quickly opening a single file or an App-folder it offers full Git integration there is a 2sxc code-snippet extension for VS-Code Use Git to Version your Work - In Local Systems as Well Style 21.01 + Do always initialize your solution (both App or Content ) into a local git regularly commit your work into your local git ```diff Consider ``` publish your work to a server git, like github or your company internal git-repo adding a readme.md for everybody who is new to your system diff ? Why if ever you want to undo something later on, you'll be glad you have older versions if ever you want to compare a deployed version with your dev-history, you'll be glad 2sxc supports git and github by placing everything in files, and also exporting the database into a git-versionable XML Use International Naming Strategy Style 11.21 + Do use english words for all content-types, fields, file-names, folder-names and variables ? Why easier to share both code and partial solutions consistent setup, as often other languages will be added and English is the best shared language fewer problems when writing code using English variable names and english property names avoid special characters/words of other languages in code-parts User Nice, Localized Naming for Editor UX Style 11.22 + Do provide localized (translated) names for everything the editor sees, to improve his user experience after creating the english-named items you can translate them into any other culture to improve the end-user experience use nice labels with spaces and more, making it easy to read apply this for all content-types in the main Content (as they are shown in normal drop-downs), view-names both in Content as well as Apps and field-names and help-texts diff ? Why great editor user experience fewer editor mistakes and frustrations Solution Architecture ...to do... File and Folder Structure LIFT Style xx.xx + Do structure the app such that you can Locate code quickly, Identify the code at a glance, keep the Flattest structure you can, and Try to be DRY. place a nice app-icon.png file containing the app-image and place it in the main folder make sure it is square and at least 200x200, ideally 500x500px in size diff ? Why LIFT Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. To confirm your intuition about a particular structure, ask: can I quickly open and start work in all of the related files for this feature? consistent with other style guides See also Locate , Identify , Flat and T-DRY of the Angular Style Guide. Provide an app-icon.png in each App folder Style xx.xx + Do create an icon for each app place a nice app-icon.png file containing the app-image and place it in the main folder make sure it is square and at least 200x200, ideally 500x500px in size diff ? Why In a future version, app-choice will also show an icon. Provide one today to be sure that it will look great. Place only Template-Files in the Main Folder Style xx.xx + Do place all templates and sub-templates in the main folder of the App or the Content place all non-template files in sub-folders diff ? Why This provides for a maximum overview when working on solutions It ensures the developer sees all views that exist Note: there are a few system files which will also reside in this folder, especially the app-icon.png . This of course will also be in this folder. Use src and dist folders Style xx.xx + Consider place all original assets incl. images, js, css into the src folder place all runtime files incl. copies of the images, compiled js/css into the dist folder diff ? Why Modern developement uses many source files and much fewer runtime files it's a big help to keep them clearly desingnated the src with dist structure has been very established in the web and JS community Structure the folders by Topic/Component Style xx.xx + Do structure your folders - especially in src - by topic containing all files of that topic, no matter what type place different file types (js/css) belonging to the same topic into the same folder ```diff Avoid ``` organizing your folders by data-type (js, images, etc.) diff ? Why consistently works both for large and simple solutions easier to maintain easier to grow into larger solutions consistent with recommendations of other style guides like the Angular Style-Guide Content-Types ...to do...

    "keywords": "@Edit.Enable(...) Method in C# Razor Purpose / Description Editing or adding data to a 2sxc app requires the UI to have some JS, CSS and context information. This is only loaded/included for editors/admin/super-users, and not available for users with limited permissions. If you want to enable this for more restricted users - for example when you want to use the 2sxc-form to let users add data - this must be enabled. That's what Edit.Enable(...) is for. How to use This example shows how you enable the UI using Razor, which will allow public users to create data: <div> @Edit.Enable(api: true, forms: true, context: true, autoToolbar: false) </div> This example ensures that api : basic JS for editing are loaded, allowing you to then run javascript commands like $2sxc(...).run(...) forms : additional JS is loaded, enabling the standard form dialogs to open context : the html contains context-information about the app, so that the dialogs actually work - see also edit context the auto-toolbars are disabled (this would generate a default toolbar if no toolbar was specified) Usage Notes This command simply enables editing - but doesn't provide any permissions or show any buttons yet. Here are a few things you must know to get this to work: remember to set permissions to allow what you want to do (like create new draft items for public users) Edit.Enable uses named parameters , so you always have to use the api: true syntax the Edit.Enable won't output anything in the position it's added, because it controls the main wrapper you must also create a link or toolbar in your code for the public users, as they won't have a button to press otherwise The parameters api bool, optional ensures javascripts are loaded enabling commands to run forms bool, optional ensures javascripts are loaded enabling forms to open context bool, optional ensures that the context information is provided in the DOM styles bool, optional ensures styles to be loaded, which would be necessary for the standard toolbars to look right autoToolbar bool, optional disables the automatic generation of a toolbar (this is important, as there usually won't be a toolbar in public pages, which would then trigger the fallback-toolbar to be generated) Read also Tutorial app for Public Forms Blog Recipe for using Public Forms with 2sxc Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App TODO History Introduced in 2sxc 9.30"

This folder will be ignored when you export an app bower_components contains bower (run-time) dependencies for your JS and can become very large. Normally you will not want this in your app (because it contains a lot of unneeded stuff) so it too will not be exported when you create an app-package.

    "title": "DataSource API: AsEntity | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "DataSource API: AsEntity Purpose / Description Many data sources generate new content items - either because they deliver some kind of information, or because they convert data from another source into standardized entities. This is where AsEntity helps. How to use AsEntity Here's a simple example of the tutorial DateTime DataSource : // create demo 1 entity with values related to today // first place all values in a dictionary // then convert into an Entity var today = new Dictionary<string, object> { {\"Title\", \"Date Today\"}, {\"Date\", DateTime.Today}, {\"DayOfWeek\", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek.ToString()}, {\"DayOfWeekNumber\", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek} }; // ...now convert to an entity, and add to the list of results var basic = AsEntity(today); var recommended = AsEntity(today, \"Title\", \"DateTimeInfo\"); This example shows how an entity-object is build using the basic syntax AsEntity(today) or with more configuration. Concept Behind AsEntity Internally, AsEntity will generate an IEntity object which is a simpler version of the normal Entity, because it's actually an IEntityLight , meaning it's missing some advanced features like multi-language and repository identity (which would be important in edit-scenarios). The simplest way is to just use AsEntity(someDictionary) , more advanced uses also tell the system which field is the title, some numeric or Guid IDs and more. Overloads / Variations The most common use case will be IEntity AsEntity(Dictionary<string, object> values); The full versions with all optional parameters as of 2sxc 9.13 is: // single item IEntity AsEntity( Dictionary<string, object> values, string titleField, string typeName, int id, Guid? guid, DateTime? modified, int? appId ) // many items IEnumerable<IEntity> AsEntity( IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>> itemValues, string titleField = null, string typeName = UnspecifiedType, int? appId = null ) All paramaters are optional, except the values. Here's what each one does: string titleField is the title field name, so the entity then also knows which one is the title and can support .EntityTitle property string typeName is a nice name for the type, allowing for type-filtering later in other data sources int id gives a number identity, so .EntityId is usefull and filtering by EntityId (like when having details-pages needing this id) works Guid guidId is a UUID identity, so .EntityGuid is usefull DateTime modified would allow to filter / sort by the .Modified property int appId could be used to pretend it's part of another app. This only affects the AppId property, and ATM there is no important reason to do this.

    "keywords": "DataSource API: Provide Purpose / Description DataSources always provide data on an Out stream. The Provide method makes it very easy to do. How to use Provide In general, you need to have a private method - usually called GetList() that would return a list of items, if it is called use that GetList() to build a stream, which has a name - typically Default attach that stream to the Out so that it's accessible Here's a simple example of the constructor of the DnnFormAndList DataSource , which provides the default stream: public DnnFormAndList() { // Specify what out-streams this data-source provides. Usually just one, called \"Default\" Provide(GetList); // does everything // ... } private IEnumerable<Eav.Interfaces.IEntity> GetList() { // ... } This example ensures that the .Out[\"Default\"] as well as the .List (which is a shorthand for .Out[Constants.DefaultStreamName].List ) are mounted, ready to deliver. Overloads Provide(listfunction) - default version, which provides the \"Default\" stream Provide(name, listfunction) - alternative for named streams when your DataSource has more streams. Providing multiple streams In case you want to offer multiple streams (like one containing products, the other categories), the common pattern is: public SomeConstructor() { Provide(GetProducts); Provide(\"Categories\", GetCategories); // ... } Read also DataSource API - DataSource API overview Ensuring configuration is parsed Demo App and further links todo History Introduced in EAV 4.x, 2sxc 09.13"

    "keywords": "EAV / 2sxc / DNN Architecture 2sxc is simple to use, but to enable that, it's pretty sophisticated on the inside. We'll give you an overview here, so you can better understand what you are using. Overall Architecture The Storage Systems This is fairly straight forward - data can be stored in SQL (spread across tables or using JSON) and the File System (stored as JSON). Note that assets like images are not handled here, but in the EAV-Apps layer (see below). The EAV Layer The data management system underneath everything is called the EAV - which stands for Entity , Attribute , Value . Anything in that namespace is about internal data models, reading/saving data etc. So anything inside the ToSic.Eav.Data is all about the internals, which you only need in special scenarios. The same applies to @ToSic.Eav.Apps.Interfaces which is the sub-system responsible for combining data into virtual bundles called Apps . You can usually ignore this. The SXC Layer On top of the EAV layer we have the Sxc layer. It's responsible for Content Management on top of the App model provided by the EAV . The Sxc layer provides things like @ToSic.Sxc.Interfaces.IDynamicEntity to let you code like @Content.Title . This is usually more interesting for you, but still fairly generic, because 2sxc is also meant to work with other platforms like NopCommerce, Orchard or Oqtane, but it hasn't been implemented yet. The DNN Layer On top of the Sxc layer we have the Dnn layer. It connects 2sxc with Dnn. Usually when you're writing code and want to know about the API, you'll typically start here, and drill down to the other APIs as needed. Architecture of the EAV Layer Inside the EAV you'll find a whole ecosystem of parts which make the magic happen. Infrastructure This is very internal stuff, to make sure everything happens. You will usually not go here. Most if it is also not public API. Areas of interest may be the ToSic.Eav.Logging or @ToSic.Eav.ValueProviders. Core Data Models This is more interesting and relevant to you, when you want to dive deep into the data model. Again you should note that this is advanced stuff. You'll find it in ToSic.Eav.Data - the most common bit you may care about is IEntity and IContentType . Data Processing This is where things get relevant for you. Check out the ToSic.Eav.DataSources to find all the bits and pieces used to process, filter and cache data. Storage This is still more an internal bit, and as of now you shouldn't use it. App System and Assets Another part that you may want to know more about. Here is where data is clustered together into virtual containers called Apps . These contain all the content-types and items of an App. It also has view-definitions, Content-Blocks (the logical unit usually called a Module in DNN) and way more. You'll find it in @ToSic.Eav.Apps.Interfaces. The assets - usually using ADAM - are found in ToSic.Eav.Apps.Assets . Web API This is ATM an internal section, mainly for connecting DNN WebAPIs to the EAV. Not documented as of now. The Fine Line Between Eav.Apps and Sxc.* To keep the architecture clean, it's important to draw a clear line between Apps and what Sxc does. Basically it's this: Eav.Apps are virtual containers bundling things together. This means content-types, data, queries, settings, etc. Sxc is all about (Web) Content Management. So anything related to views, templates, assets, content-blocks is in Sxc. Specifically, these things may not be in Apps, and must be in Sxc Templates Rendering Engines like Token/Razor Content-Blocks Custom WebApi (which is also kind of a dynamic rendering engine)"

    "title": "Concept: Features | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Concept: Features To increase the security of 2sxc, many features are only available if actively enabled . This reduced the security surface and hardens the installation . A feature is a functionality of 2sxc or EAV, which can be enabled/disabled at system level. Each feature is identified by a GUID, and all features are disabled by default. Some examples of features: define permissions by user ( new in 9.30 ) use the new (beta) Angular 5 UI for editing ( new in 9.30 ) use standard 2sxc forms to allow public users to submit data ( new in 9.30 ) let certain users save draft-only data ( new in 9.30 ) enable paste-image-from-clipboard (beta, new in 9.30 ) Behavior if Feature is Disabled If a feature is not enabled and code needs to use the feature, it will either show an error OR simply skip that functionality. This varies from feature to feature. If an error is thrown, the system will include a link to the missing feature as well as instructions to enable. Managing Features This is done through the Apps-Management. This is what it looks like: Read about managing features in the blog about features-management How the Feature-Configurations are Stored Features use a json-file called features.json located in the desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/.data-custom/configurations folder. Additional Security Mechanisms For added security, there are two layers of additional protection: The configuration contains a fingerprint of the current installation (so that an attacker cannot simply replace the features-configuration with an own copy). This fingerprint should match the fingerprint of the installation for the configuration to be valid. Read more about fingerprinting in this blog . When the configuration is created, it is signed by the 2sxc.org server using a digital certificate and verified when the features are loaded. Note: the security features are already built into 9.30 but not yet enforced. This is because it's a fairly new setup, and we want to be sure that we don't accidentally disable something if something doesn't work properly.

In certain cases it would be good if the razor-view could verify that the feature is enabled - for example to show a warning when it isn't enabled yet. This is what the Features API is for. How To Use This example is taken from Mobius Forms and the code can be found in the Mobius Github Repo . @using ToSic.Eav.Configuration @{ // show warning if the save-attachments in web api isn't activated var reqFeatures = new[]{new Guid(\"ecdab0f6-4692-4544-b1e7-72581f489f6a\")}; FeaturesDisabledException missingException; if(!Features.EnabledOrException(reqFeatures, \"Warning: file upload won't work yet, as it hasn't been enabled.\", out missingException)) { <div class=\"alert alert-warning\"> @missingException.Message </div> } } The code above checks if a feature is enabled, and if not, will show a message to the viewer that this must be enabled first. What you Need To Know The API lies in the namespace ToSic.Eav.Configuration The Features object is static, so you don't need to create it, just use the commands on it ATM the public API has the following commands Enabled(Guid featureId) which checks if a feature is enabled Enabled(IEnumerable<Guid> featureIds) which checks if multiple features are enabled EnabledOrException(IEnumerable<Guid> featIds, string message, out FeaturesDisabledException) which will check and give you an error object back, which you can either throw or show the message of (like in the example above) Finding Feature GUIDs At the moment there is no catalog of feature GUIDs yet, and sometimes you may actually create your own. So for now you'll mainly need this for features of 2sxc / eav, and you can simply look them up in the code, or see them in the features management of the installation you're developing on. Warning: there are constants in the EAV code which have these feature GUIDs, but do not use them, as they will be moved to other places in the code at a later time Read also ...

Note that if something doesn't have custom permissions, you'll still have default permissions that apply (see below): Introduction to Permissions Permissions are usually a list of zero or more permissions - like this: When you edit a permission, it looks like this: To access the permissions, you'll usually find a person-button in the actions of an item: Permission Overview Items which can accept permissions are: Content Types - permissions regulate who can create / edit items of that type Views / Templates - permissions regulate, who can see this view if accessed through url-parameter Apps - permissions regulate across all content types, who may edit/create etc. new in 9.30 Fields - permissions regulate, who may upload files new in 9.30 Permissions consist of the following parts: Requirements - what the current user must fulfill, for it to apply Grants - what is allowed with this permission Understanding Requirements For a permission to apply, you must specify for whom this is. To do this, you can choose various requirements: DNN Permissions: in this case, you can specify if the user has view permissions, this applies User Identity: in this case you can specifiy a user GUID new in 9.30, requires the feature to be enabled Group ID(s): if a user is in any of these DNN groups, the rule applies new in 9.30, requires the feature to be enabled Understanding Grants If a permission applies, it will grant the current user some rights - like creating or editing data. Grants are internally coded as a letter of the alphabet, like: c for create d for delete č for create drafts only f for full (all) permissions A grant can contain multiple rights - like crud for create, read, update, delete. Many grants like f will automatically grant other things (obviously). Default Permissions It's important to understand that for many scenarios, default permissions already apply. Super-users may always do everything, and admins may read/write all data. These default permissions cannot be reduced with new permissions at the moment, so an admin always has read/write and cannot be degraded to lower permissions. Using Permissions in Code As of now, the permissions API isn't final, so if you want to use it in code, you can immitate code you can find in the source. But these commands will change when the API is final, so you'll end up making adjustments.

This is mostly historic, as all new content-types will have GUIDs, but old types still exist in the system which have a nice name, but that's not ideal for various use cases. Scope is Like a Virtual Group The Scope is a name - usually System or something like that. It's primarily used to group types together, so that the editor doesn't have to see the ca. 50 types in the background which make the solution work. Attributes Have Metadata Each attribute - let's say a field \"Color\" has more information which is needed for scenarios like the edit-UI. These items are standard content-items and also have the very same format as JSON entities - you can read about that in this blog. Content Types Have Metadata Content-types can have a lot of metadata - also mostly for the UI. An example is the help-text which is shown. This too is stored as normal JSON content-items . Limitations As of now (2sxc 9.7) the system will pick up the content-types stored there and everything works. BUT there is no built-in mechanism to edit these. We (2sic) can easily create content-types in a normal 2sxc and export them to json for this purpose, but as of now there is no GUI to do so. This should not affect you, as it's not meant to be managed by anybody else than us as of now. Special Stuff about the JSON Format Here are some things that may seem unusual at first: Content Type Attributes must preserve Sort Order This is important, as it's relevant to the UI. All Attributes are Grouped by Type Because JSON is itself a very loose data-format, and certain types like dates are not auto-detectable, we decided to have the type-specification as a first-class citizen in the format. This allows for automatic, reliable type-checking when materializing objects. All values have language information As we're usually working with real-life content-items, multi-language is always a concern. Because of this, every value is multi-language by default. If the language code is *, that means that this value is the default/fallback value for all languages. Metadata is a Recursive List of Entities 2sxc and the EAV is all about real-life content-management. As such, many pieces of information have more information attached, called Metadata. Metadata-items could themselves have their own Metadata, which is then of course attached as well.

You can set many things, in this demo we only set: GlobalName (required) - this is used for lookup/storing a reference to this source), should be unique NiceName (optional) a nice label in the UI HelpLink (optional) a help-link there are more properties, but these are the important ones. More on the Constructor and Provide The constructor is in charge of wiring up the data-source. It should not get any data - because the data may not be needed and because configuration isn't loaded yet. The important command you need to know is Provide . This will do a few things Ensure that the Out stream offers a stream with a name - if not specified it's going to offer the Default stream. Wire that up to the method (in this case GetList) which will be called if the Out -stream is ever requested More on the GetList Method and AsEntity The first thing you need to know is that it won't be called if nobody requests the Out stream. If the the Out is requested, this method must return a list (actually an enumerable) of Entities. The most common way to build entities is to prepare a Dictionary<string, object> and convert it to an Entity using AsEntity . Note that AsEntity has many more features, which are not in this demo to keep it simpler. Notes and Clarifications We'll add some more advanced samples in a few days...

There are many data-sources, and most of them will... ...either get data from somewhere external like SQL, CSV, REST or the EAV-cache and provide this for further use - then it's a pure IDataSource ...or receive data from another DataSource, then process/filter this and provide the result for further use, in which case it's both an IDataSource as well as an IDataTarget So DataSources can be joined together into a Query to do amazing things, like a CsvDataSource can read a CSV-file and provide the data as a stream on Entities on csvDs[\"Default\"] ... ...and pipe the result it to a CacheDataSource which caches the data for x-minutes ...then pipe it to a ValueFilterDataSource , which only shows the items where the Country matches the Url-parameters country ...then pipe it to a ValueSortDataSource, ordering it by LastName and then FirstName ...then pipe it to another CacheDataSource so that this common filter/sort combination will be kept for 5 minutes and then the result can be used in a Template or streamed as JSON to a JavaScript SPA. Understanding Data-Flow between DataSource Objects Each DataSource has a list of out-streams available on the .Out[\"StreamName\"] property, but usually access directly just with the DataSourceName[\"StreamName\"] . This is what also happens when you use the Data object and write foreach(var item in Data[\"Default\"]) . Aside from consuming data in your your template, most data-sources will simply offer the Out-Stream to other DataSources for further processing. Technically it's mapped like this: Cache.Out[\"Default\"] > ContentTypeFilter.In[\"Default\"] ... then some magic happens inside the ContentTypeFilter ... then the ContentTypeFilter.Out[\"Default\"] has the resulting items, which can again be used as an In on another DataSource, or simply used in your template Most DataSources will only have one In-stream and one Out-stream, but this is very variable depending on your need. Creating your own Custom DataSource short instruction to get started here's docs about the relevant API understanding configuration injection Understanding Configuration of Each DataSource Object The configuration uses a sophisticated token system to provide all necessary information. It is explained here . Common Use Cases of DataSource in C# Code You will usually use DataSource objects in these common cases: when templating in Razor, the Data object is a DataSource, usually having a Default stream ( Data[\"Default\"] ) and sometimes further streams like Data[\"ListContent\"] or Data[\"Categories\"] etc. when templating, the App.Data is also a DataSource providing a stream for each content-type in this app, like App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] or App.Data[\"Tag\"] every query is technically a DataSource, and in the query you define which DataStreams it has - if ever you use it in code, you'll see that App.Query[\"SortedTags\"] would be a DataSource and typically the Default stream would contain all these tags. a query is always a chain of DataSource doing one operation and passing it on to the next DataSource. How to use In your Razor-templates you'll usually work with these three sources: Data App.Data App.Query[...] Please read more about these in links. Creating DataSource Objects in C#/Razor Code Sometimes you want to have full control over what a DataSource does or what parameters it's using. This is easy: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Authors\"; // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors[\"Default\"]; Creating a Query in Code by Piping / Chaining Data sources What the visual-designer does is configure how DataSources are attached, mapping their in/out streams and adding parameters. You can also do this in code, but it's fairly advanced. You would usually want to do this, if you want to use a filter or something, but need to provide parameters which aren't available in the Visual Query Designer. Here's a simple example: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Author\"; // Sort by FullName var sortedAuthors = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthors.Attributes = \"FullName\"; // Sort by Fullname descending var sortedAuthorsDesc = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsDesc.Attributes = \"FullName\"; sortedAuthorsDesc.Directions = \"desc\"; // Sort by 2 fields var sortedAuthorsMult = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsMult.Attributes = \"Website,FullName\"; sortedAuthorsMult.Directions = \"asc, desc\"; // sort by internal EntityId var sortedAuthorsById = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsById.Attributes = \"EntityId\"; Because the first allAuthors didn't specify an up-stream in the () empty brackes, it automatically gets attached to the App-Cache with all the data of the current app. So var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); will initially have all content-items at it's disposal. The most important thing to notice is that each additional data-source uses the first allAuthors DataSource as the default upstream DataSource. So when these sort/filter or do something, they will only receive the data already filtered by the allAuthors.

    "keywords": "DataStream Basics (IDataStream) Purpose / Description DataStreams are objects which behave like a table, delivering a bunch of content-items. Common examples in Razor-templates are: the Data[\"Default\"] is a data-stream containing all content-items assigned to this template, ready to show the App.Data[\"Tag\"] is a data-stream containing all tag-items in the entire app. How to use The most commen uses will loop through all items in such a stream and show them. Here's an example: <ol> @foreach(var person in Data[\"Default\"]) { <li>@AsDynamic(person).FullName</li> } </ol> The @foreach will go through all the items. Each item is of the type IEntity . To make it easier to template, we convert it to a Dynamic Entity using AsDynamic and then we can just show the name with .FullName . In most cases we will need the loop-item a lot, and would preferr to not write AsDynamic every time. Because of this, we usually write the AsDynamic in the Loop, like this: <ol> @foreach(var person in AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"])) { <li>@person.FullName - born @person.Birthday and married to @person.SpouseName</li> } </ol> Advanced Use Cases There are some advanced use-cases where you need to know more about the IDataStream object, mostly when using LINQ. This is fairly rare, and if you really need to know more, it's best to consult the EAV DataSource code. Just a few more details you might care about: The stream has a property Source which points to the owning DataSource . a stream might be attached to many targets for further processing or for templating, but the stream doesn't know about this you can always enumerate the stream itself using LINQ, like var blues = Data[\"Default\"].Where(x => AsDynamic(x).Category == \"Blue\")) if you want more control over what you're looping through, there are two properties: the List property which is a IDictionary<int, IEntity> , and also lets you access it directly with your entityId if known, like Data[\"Default\"].List[1753] the LightList which is an IEnumerable<IEntity> of course there's always quite a bit more to it, like auto-caching, but you usually don't need to understand all that.

    "keywords": "Querying Data and Data Sources with code and LINQ To get started, we recommend you read the LINQ Guide and play around with the Razor Tutorial App These common (extension) methods can be used on lists from 2sxc data streams (they all inherit from types implementing IEnumerable ): .Where() - filter a list (IEnumerable) based on a specific criteria .Any() - returns true if any of the elements matches a criteria .OrderBy() / .OrderByDescending() - order a list (IEnumerable) by a specific field .First() / .Last() - get first or last element in the list .Select() - transform list into a new list, selecting specific field(s) .Take() / .Skip() - paging functions .Count() - count number of elements .IndexOf() - find index of a specific element in the list For a full list of all System.Linq methods, check out the methods of IEnumerable Using Statements As explained in the guide we recommend the following using statements in Razor: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; Where Filter a list (IEnumerable) based on a criteria. Example: Basic filter of a list by string var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.Where(p => p.Name == \"Chuck Norris\"); // items now contains only items which have \"Chuck Norris\" as name property Any Returns true if any of the elements matches a criteria. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var containsChuckNorris = items.Any(p => p.Name == \"Chuck Norris\"); // if containsChuckNorris is true, at least one element has name \"Chuck Norris\" Here's another Any - to see if a relationship contains something. It's a bit more complex, because Razor needs to know what it's working with: // filter - keep only those that have this Category // note that the compare must run on the EntityId because of object wrapping/unwrapping postsToShow = postsToShow .Where(p => (p.Categories as List<dynamic>) .Any(c => c.EntityId == ListContent.Category[0].EntityId)) OrderBy / OrderByDescending Order a list (IEnumerable) by a specific field. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.OrderBy(p => p.Name); // items are now ordered by property \"Name\" First / Last Get first or last element of the list. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var first = items.First(); // contains the first element var last = items.Last(); // contains the last element Select Transform list into a new list, selecting only specified field(s). var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var names = items.Select(p => p.Name); // names is a list of all names Take / Skip Paging functions: Take only n elements, skip m elements var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.Skip(10).Take(10); // Skips the first 10 elements and select only 10 Count Count number of elements in a list. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var count = items.Count(); // contains the number of elements in the list IndexOf Find index of a specific element in the list. @{ var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); } @foreach(var item in items) { <h1>Item number @items.IndexOf(item)</h1> }"

    "title": "Concept: In-Page Edit-Item Toolbars and Buttons | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Concept: In-Page Edit-Item Toolbars and Buttons 2sxc provides super-fast in-page buttons and toolbars for the content-editor to manage and edit everything. The system is very advanced, so what at first may seem trivial can become very complex as you go deeper into customizing it. This is why we are providing an overview. Best Practice: Hover vs. Inline Toolbars The toolbars for the editor can be hovering above the elements - usually appearing on mouse-over, or directly inline. Hover-toolbars can also be configured to always be visible, but this is a rare use case. Recommendation Hover-Toolbars are highly recommended. These appear when the mouse moves over the item to be edited. It gives the editor a perfect preview of the page, without cluttering the screen with buttons. Toolbars which hover and are always visible make sense for buttons which the editor may not discover on his own if they are not always visible, or when the item to hover on would be very small, and hard to discover. Inline (non-hovering) toolbars which are always visible should be used as rarely as possible. A good use for this are admin-tables where each row should directly show the edit-button in a buttons-column. How the System Work To make the magic work, these parts are involved: Server side code detects that editing is allowed. This automatically adds context-information to the module in the form of a hidden JSON attribute. You can see these large attributes in the source-code if you are logged in. It also ensures that the edit-javascripts are loaded by the page. This is either auto-detected, because the user has edit-rights Or it was explicitly enabled using [ @Edit.Enable(...) in razor](xref:Razor.EditEnable]. Server side code adds stuff to mark where toolbars should appear... ...either (new in 2sxc 9.40) it adds hidden JSON attributes called sxc-toolbar='{...}' to any tag that should have a hover-menu with the desired configuration and settings , added like this <div @Edit.TagToolbar(...)>...</div> in razor ...or it adds an empty <ul toolbar='{...}' settings='{...}> tag to the page, also with the configuration and settings , added using @Edit.Toolbar(...) in razor or the [Content.Toolbar] equivalent in tokens . These toolbars can also hover using an old convention of adding an sc-element class, but that is deprecated since 2sxc 9.40. JavaScript on the client looks at the HTML and picks up both the special <ul> tags as well as all tags having the sxc-toolbar attribute, reads the configuration and generates the necessary html-tags with the buttons and hover-effects. Based on the context-information and the configuration it will choose if advanced button should appear (like edit-template, which only admins should see). Special hover-placement and other visual things are picked up from the settings . If an editor interacts with the menu, each click will result in JavaScript looking at the closest context-information in the page, and using this information to run a command like edit , new or template-develop . When a command has completed, certain code may reload the view, either using ajax or by reloading the page if ajax is not supported by this particular view. Short Example The toolbar system is 100% JavaScript but offers special helpers to improve the experience in other dev-environments. Here's a simple example using Razor: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> This creates a invisible toolbar which appears and hovers when the mouse moves over the <h1> tag (if the user has edit-permissions). The toolbar has all the buttons for this Content item. The next example is similar, but instead of all default buttons it only shows the edit-button: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, actions: \"edit\")> @Content.Title </h1> Basic Toolbar Concepts and Functionality each toolbar is specific to a content-item a page can have many toolbars, each for a different element / purpose usually toolbars are invisible until the mouse hovers over the area to be edited (best practice, but configurable) various show and hover/float behaviors each toolbar is fully customizable - both in regards to which buttons are shown as well as how they are grouped, how they look etc. toolbars are multi-language easy to add in your template or to your JS Apps mobile capable with shake support How to Use We'll try to provide you with full details of the toolbars for advanced use cases. But in most cases you will need the default toolbars minimal or no customizations. For these common cases you should continue on. Razor @Edit.TagToolbar(...) attribute (hovering, recommended) Razor @Edit.Toolbar(...) (non-hovering) Token Toolbars (using simpler placeholder templates) Core JavaScript Architecture Parts Commands This is what is executed when a button is clicked. Commands are things like edit . Some commands need additional parameters like EntityId , resulting in a command more like run('edit', {EntityId: 27}) . Commands can also be run without toolbars, for example from edit links in tables etc. You can read more about Commands, incl. the full list of current command, parameters and how to create custom commands in the Commands section. Buttons This is a square thingy with an icon, which is will run a Command . When the button is created, it is fully configured with icon, commmand and command-parameters. Button-Group : This is a set of one or more -Buttons_ which are shown together. Often there will be a more button at one end of the set, which will show another button-group when clicked. Toolbar : This is a set of one or more Button-Groups . Toolbar Builder : This is an API-layer which builds the HTML for the Toolbar . Toolbar Bootstrapper : This will pick up HTML placeholders for toolbars and run the Toolbar Builder for these. Defaults : For the entire chain to work properly, various initial configurations Read also quickE - the quick-edit hover toolbar - the quick-edit hover-toolbar for inserting/moving modules Inner Content Blocks - blog about inner content-blocks Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App 2sxc blog History Added toolbars in 2sxc 1.0 ca. 2011 hundreds of ongoing optimizations Added new feature with the Edit.TagToolbar which works using an sxc-toolbar attribute instead of an <ul> tag in 2sxc 9.40. In this version we also changed the CSS functionality to not use the sc-element attribute, but still support it for backward compatibility."

    "title": "Concept: Inner Content 2.0 | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Concept: Inner Content 2.0 Inner Content is the feature to place content-blocks (apps or common content-items) inside another content-item. There are two common scenarios for this: Apps with list/details views, with a feature rich details-view . For example: a blog, which lets the editor add galleries and other apps into each blog-post. This is called a mashup app as it mixes apps together Apps which wrap other content/apps, for example an accordion-app which lets the editor add further content-blocks or apps into each collapsing segment. Basic Concept Inner Content links other content-blocks (apps, content) to a Content Item , allowing the template to then show this inner content where it wants to. An Item can have Many Sets of Inner-Content A template can have multiple sets of inner content. For example: a real-estate app showing a details-page with 2 columns, each containing an variety of content-items, different from house-item to house-item. One house could have a gallery-app in the first column, while the other house would have a 3D walkthrough app and preferr to use the gallery in the second column a Catalog app containing many WYSIWYG text blocks (ProductDescription, ShowCase, ApplicationSuggestions) shown in multiple tabs, each WYSIWYG containing apps inline between the paragraphs. To achieve this flexibility, the Inner Content items are linked not only to a Content Item but to a specific field in that item. So each set of related items is stored in one field, and by using multiple fields you can have multiple sets of items. This allows the template to handle each set separately. Standalone Inner-Content - like a DNN Pane just for this item A common use case is to provide the editor with an area into which he/she can add as many content-blocks/apps as they want to. This feels like a DNN-pane - the editor just adds apps as he needs them. This mode is common for mashup-apps and is mostly used on sophisticated details-pages with a clear area containing additional functionality. It's also common in layout-changing apps like the accordion app . In WYSIWYG Inner-Content this is new in 2sxc 8.9 Sometimes you may let the editor add inner-content blocks within a wysiwyg-field, so that normal written content can be interspersed with apps. This is common in news-style apps or blogs, where additional features are needed (galleries, code-snippets, etc.) but mixed with the main text and not in a separate area. Here is a blog tutorial on implementing Very Rich Text . The Parts that Make it Work For Inner Content to work, the following parts play together: Data storage : you need fields in your content-type to link to the external content blocks. Just create entity-fields and use the type Content Block Items . In many cases you also want to hide the field because it's not important to the content-editor. Just go to the field-settings and set Visible in Edit UI to off. Content-Block rendering in the templates, using the Razor API - it is prepared both for the standalone-area-mode as well as the merge-with-wysiwyg-mode. In-Page Editing : to allow the editor to add / edit content-blocks in the normal view, the UI must support it. This is handeled automatically by Quick-Edit . To do the in-page Editing, quickE needs to know some context information (what field to store the links in, etc.), provided in an HTML-attribute. It's either rendered in automatically when using the Razor commands or you can manually place them using [context attributes](xref:Razor.ContextAttributes]. If you want the WYSIWYG-integration the wysiwyg must know which field to use to manage the linked content-blocks. This is simply done by convention: as soon as a content-block field follows right after a wysiwyg-field, they will be linked and the button will appear. This also works it the content-block field is set to invisible.

    "keywords": "Concept: In-Page Edit Context To ensure that client-side commands like edit can work (this includes all toolbar functionalities), the in-page scripts must pick up various things like AppId and more. This is provided as an Edit-Context and looks a bit like this: <div data-edit-context='{ \"Environment\":{\"WebsiteId\":0,\"WebsiteUrl\":\"//.../en/\",\"PageId\":56,\"PageUrl\":\"http://.../en/\",\"parameters\":[{\"Key\":\"TabId\",\"Value\":\"56\"},{\"Key\":\"language\",\"Value\":\"en-US\"}],\"InstanceId\":421,\"SxcVersion\":\"9.30.0.40333\",\"SxcRootUrl\":\"/\",\"IsEditable\":true}, \"User\":{\"CanDesign\":true,\"CanDevelop\":true}, \"Language\":{\"Current\":\"en-us\",\"Primary\":\"en-us\",\"All\":[]}, \"ContentBlock\":{\"ShowTemplatePicker\":true,\"IsEntity\":false,\"VersioningRequirements\":\"DraftOptional\",\"Id\":421,\"ParentFieldName\":null,\"ParentFieldSortOrder\":0,\"PartOfPage\":true}, \"ContentGroup\":{\"IsCreated\":true,\"IsList\":false,\"TemplateId\":3770,\"QueryId\":null,\"ContentTypeName\":\"e2351b42-87f2-427e-9566-ff271e3e5a9f\",\"AppUrl\":\"/Portals/0/2sxc/Content\",\"AppSettingsId\":null,\"AppResourcesId\":null,\"IsContent\":true,\"HasContent\":true,\"SupportsAjax\":true,\"ZoneId\":2,\"AppId\":2,\"Guid\":\"c238e78b-a6e5-4811-a5c9-51d5ebf48b39\",\"Id\":3894}, \"error\":{\"type\":null}, \"Ui\":{\"AutoToolbar\":true}}'> <span>more stuff...</span> </div> How the Edit-Context is Added By default, it is automatically added if the system detects that the current user has edit-permissions. In 2sxc 9.30 a feature was added to add the context in code, using the [Edit.Enable(...)](xref:Razor.EditEnable] command. Inner-Context for Inner Content When inner content is used, each block of inner-content will change the context, because it will have different IDs etc. So inner-content blocks will add their own context-attributes. See also [Edit.ContextAttributes](xref:Razor.ContextAttributes]. How JS Picks up the Context In most cases the context is picked up automatically - like in such a code: <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).run('edit', ...)\">edit</a> This kind of code traverses the HTML to look for the closes context-node, and uses it to figure out everything automatically. The second auto-pickup method uses the module/content-block ID, like this: <a onclick=\"$2sxc(4203).run('edit', ...)\">edit</a> This will also find the context, but instead of traversing the DOM upwards, it will check all DOM objects on the page and find the appropriate one for this ID. What's in the Context This information is just conceptual. Do NOT try to access these values in your code, because they will change, and it's not part of any public API! . The concept contains things like: versions (so that the UI can behave as needed and correctly load scripts with cache-breaking) urls so the GUI can perform certain actions correctly language information for the GUI various IDs like the current zone/app, item-IDs, module-IDs etc. Using Edit Context in Your Code You should not use this in your code, as it's not a public api and will change from time to time.

Each of these has the following parameters url or settings required string|object: a Url for the end-point OR a { ... } settings object params optional object: the url params like { id: 27, name: \"hello\" } data optional object: the data - in case of post / put, like { ... } preventAutoFail optional bool: if true, won't automatically show a default message on error, so that you can handle errors differently Quick examples: var sxc = $2sxc(27); sxc.webApi.post(\"Form/ProcessForm\", {}, data, true) .success(function() { // .... }) .error(function() { // ... }); This will call the C# WebApi controller FormController in the api folder and go for its ProcessForm command. It will use no url-params, but put a data object in the body (as json), and will do error-handling itself. Till we find time to document more, please consult the source Using App-Queries with $2sxc (TODO) Todo: must document more about this In short: use $2sxc(...).webApi.get(...) or $2sxc(...).webApi.post(...) etc. for the path-parameter, use a path starting with app/auto/query/[queryname] - 2sxc will take care of all the path resolutions if the path starts with app/auto/query/ Till we find time to document more, please consult the source Working with Custom C# App WebAPIs (TODO) TODO - must document more about what the web-apis are (link to more documentation) In short: use $2sxc(...).webApi.get(...) or $2sxc(...).webApi.post(...) etc. for the path-parameter, use a path starting with app/auto/api/[controller]/[action] - 2sxc will take care of all the path resolutions if the path starts with app/auto/api/ You can read more about the C# WebApi Server Side Short note: the WebAPIs work like classic javascript promises.

    "title": "Html & JS: Button Definitions | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Html & JS: Button Definitions Purpose / Description When you create custom buttons in a floating toolbar you can customize everything including the icon and more. This is explained here. Buttons are of html, basically a <a click=\"...\">[some-icon]</a> . When the button is created, it must already know what it's for, which is why the command must be prepared when the button is created. How to use A short example of a slightly customized button definition: var btns = [{ command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Category\" }, title: \"create Category\" }, { command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Author\" }, title: \"create Author\" }]; This simple example shows two new buttons creating different kinds of things, and we customized the label so the mouse-over would tell the editor which button is which. Let's get a bit more sophisticated var btn = { command: { // some command here }, icon: \"icon-sxc-code\", title: \"this is my special button\", classes: \"redButton\", }; The above example shows all than can currently be configured one a button. And here's a much more complex example. This is the full object-structure which the button generator getButton(...) understands: // full version var btn = { title: \"some title - ideally from translation table\", icon: \"some icon like icon-sxc-bomb\", command: { action: \"some action name like new\", moreParamsAsNeeded: \"...\" }, showCondition: someValueOr function(itemSettings) { return true; }, classes: \"btn-xyz my-class\", dynamicClasses: function(itemSettings) { if( (new Date()).getDay() === 1 ) return \"color-monday\"; } }; // typically more compact edition (will be expanded at runtime) var btn2 = { title: \"my button!\", icon: \"icon-sxc-list\", action: \"layout\" }; // or the totally compact edition var btn3 = \"layout\"; Some functioning code You may wonder how to actually use this. Here's an JSON example: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see inline-json version <ul class=\"sc-menu\" data-toolbar='[{ \"command\": { \"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Category\" }, \"title\": \"create Category\" }, { \"command\": { \"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Author\" }, \"title\": \"create Author\" }]'></ul> </p> Here's a more sophisticated (but also more reusable) example: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the buttons-list <toolbars2Buttons></toolbars2Buttons> </p> <script> var toolbars2Buttons = [{ command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Category\" }, title: \"create Category\" }, { command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Author\" }, title: \"create Author\" }]; // note that we cannot create the toolbars before the page-onready. Because of this // our code which creates the toolbar must be delayed, like in a $(our-code); $(function(){ if(typeof $2sxc != \"undefined\") // continue if $2sxc exists; it may be missing in non-edit modes $(\"toolbars2Buttons\").each(function(index, element){ var controller = $2sxc(element); if(!controller.isEditMode()) // check if this specific module currently allows editing return; var toolbar = controller.manage.getToolbar(toolbars2Buttons); $(element).replaceWith(toolbar); }); }); </script> How it works Buttons are used in toolbars all the time, and before they are rendered, the must be fully configured/expanded, as shown in the larger example. Internally the button is built with whatever is given, and anything not defined yet is automatically filled with the defaults. The defaults are taken from the commands definitions . Here's how the get defaults works: if all that is knows about a button is the name like var btn = \"new\" , then it gets all the configuration from the defaults if some properties are known, like var btn = { command: {action: \"new\"}, icon: \"myicon\" } , then only the missing properties are taken from the defaults. Note that retrieving defaults requires the button to know which command it's for, so the name of the command is essential. The Button Properties object command the internal command which will be called, should contain both the name and the parameters like { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\"} see also commands string icon a css class giving the button the icon. It can be one of the icons 2sxc provides, or it can be your own - just be sure to include a CSS & font which resolves the icon string title a text which is shown on mouse-over. Note that 2sxc will try to run it through the translator, so you can also use placeholders like Toolbar.Metadata string classes comma separated list of class-names like makeRed,glowHover function dynamicClasses(settings) can be used to dynamically build classes depending on the situation bool/function showCondition ( API still experimental ) - used to dynamically choose if this button should be shown or not bool disabled ( API still experimental ) would disable the click on a button bool partOfPage ( API still experimental , new in 2sxc 9.5 ) determines if resulting changes should effect the Evoq/DNN Page Publishing - note that it only effects the page-lifecyle, if the resulting dialogs and APIs respect this setting Some more Notes Because the button is often passed around as plain text/html, it can't rely on hidden variables to keep track of anything. This is why the onclick is so verbose, like onclick=\"$2sxc(4030).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"entityId\": 42 }) . This is to ensure it always survives the text-round-trip.

    "title": "Html & JS: Calling Commands of the CMS | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Html & JS: Calling Commands of the CMS Purpose / Description Whenever you press a button in the edit-ui, a edit-command is handled by the javascript layer. These commands are things like edit an item on the screen open the layout -picker dialog for a content-block To keep things simple, these commands all have the convention of using a short command name like new , some parameters like entityId which differ for each command and usually some context like this is happening in the module 7503 . How to use In most cases you don't have to even think about this, because the hover-buttons will automatically call the command as needed. But there are cases where you may want to do so yourself - for example with very custom buttons or if you want to automate something. Here's an example: <!-- quick version with name only --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run('layout', event)\"> change layout </a> <!-- expanded version --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run({ action: 'layout' }, event)\"> change layout </a> <!-- expanded version with many params --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run({ action: 'new', contentType: 'BlogPost' }, event)\"> createBlogPost </a> These examples example gets the $2sxc-controller related to the <a> tag using $2sxc(this) and thereby giving it a context so it knows what module-id, etc. Then it executes the command. Here's a fairly realistic setup using Razor and custom buttons in HTML: @if(Permissions.UserMayEditContent) { <ol> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"layout\"})'>layout</a> </li> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Dummy\"})'>new</a> </li> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"entityId\": @Content.EntityId})'>edit #@Content.EntityId</a> </li> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"useModuleList\": true, \"sortOrder\": 0 })'>edit slot 0 of module list</a> </li> <li>manage table of <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"contentitems\"})'>items of the type used in this template</a> or of <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"contentitems\", contentType: \"Quotes\"})'>Quotes</a> </li> </ol> } Maybe you also want to put the command-construction in more code, like this: // the function which does this function openLayout(moduleId){ var command = { action: \"layout\" } $2sxc(moduleId).manage.run(command); } // the jquery call to do this on-load $(function() { openLayoutOnPageLoad(740); }) Running a Command Always use the sxc-controller of a module, then access the .manage.run(...) method to run a command. There are 3 calls you can use: run(\"layout\") - for simple commands requiring only the name run(\"new\", { contentType: \"BlogPost\" }) - for additional parameters run({ action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }) - does the same as above run(..., event) - if you had an event like click, it's best to always include it as last parameter Some Examples Every action in the UI is a command, and for it to run, it must know a few things, like var sxc = $2sxc(7523); // get sxc for moduleId 7523 var newCommand = { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }; sxc.manage.run(newCommand); var editItemCommand = { action: \"edit\", entityId: 760 }; sxc.manage.run(editItemCommand); var editSlot7Params = { useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 7 }; sxc.manage.run(\"edit\", editSlot7Params); Command With Custom Code There is a command called custom which is meant to be used for this.

This page explains the In-Browser things you must know, incl. JSON configuration Concept and Background For this please read Concept-Quick-Edit , which also explains how to include it in a Skin etc. How to use Assuming that the $quickE is already on the page and you're logged on, there is not much to do for now. Note that the internal API of $quickE is still prone to change, so anything you do which isn't officially documented could brake on a future upgrade. Configuring quickE Quick-Edit in HTML Since quickE 2.0 (released in 2sxc 8.7) you can now also configure it a bit. Here are the most important features enable / disable the entire quickE enable / disable module quick-edit enable / disable inner-block quick edit To do this, just add a quick-edit-config=\"{...}\" attribute to any DOM node with the desired configuration. Here's what will happen if you add it to a skin-dom-node, you can set \"defaults\" like \"never enable at all\" if you add it to a view-template, you can change the behavior if that view is included Why include configuration it in a View? As explained above, quickE changes it's behavior by default if it finds inner-content. This is desired on details-views, but not on templates which just create more complex content on a normal page. So on these templates, you could add a config to continue enabling module-quick-edit. The Configuration Object Structure config = { enable: true, // default modules: { enable: null // auto-detect, can also be true/false }, innerBlocks: { enable: null // auto-detect, can also be true/false } } A Quick Razor Example If you want to add this attribute only when the user is editing the page, the best way to do it is like this: <div @Edit.Attribute(\"quick-edit-config\", new { modules = new { enable = true }})> ... </div> Read also Inner Content Blocks - blog about inner content-blocks Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Accordion (collapsible sections) 2sxc blog History Introduced in 2sxc v08.04 Enhanced / made configurable in 2sxc 08.06.01"

    "keywords": "JS: Manage Everything With the manage Controller Purpose / Description The manage object helps you manage content, allowing you to run(...) commands or to get buttons or toolbars . How to use Each content-block (usually a DNN-Module) has it's own 2sxc-controller, which also gives you a prepared manage-object to work with. Here's an example <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run(\"layout\")'>layout</a> this click-event will look up the 2sxc-controller using $2sxc(this) , then use the manage-object provided by this to then run the layout command. The layout command opens the change-template dialog. Here's an example to generate a toolbar from code: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the groups of buttons <toolbarsGroups></toolbarsGroups> </p> <script> var toolbarsGroups = { groups: [ { buttons: \"layout,more\"}, { buttons: \"app,zone,more\" } ] }; $(function(){ $(\"toolbarsGroups\").each(function(index, element){ var controller = $2sxc(element); var toolbar = controller.manage.getToolbar(toolbarsGroups); $(element).replaceWith(toolbar); }); }); </script> The example above has a function which will look for all <toolbarsGroups> tags and replace them with the HTML provided by manage.getToolbar(...) . How it works Basically the manage-property only exists when the user has edit permissions, as 2sxc will automatically include the necessary JS in the page. So if the user doesn't have edit-rights, the .manage property will be undefined . If it does exist, it can be used to do perform these kinds of actions. Properties and Methods We try to keep APIs very light, so all the internal properties/objects are not documented and should not be used. These properties and methods can be treated as stable: void .run(...) - used to run a command string .getButton(...) - used to generate HTML for a single button (which when pressed, runs a command) - see buttons and toolbars string .getToolbar(...) - used to generate HTML for a toolbar (with buttons, which run commands) - see buttons and toolbars Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App JS Manage / Toolbar API Tutorial App History Introduced in 2sxc v02.00 Officially released & documented for use in 2sxc v08.06"

    "title": "Html: In-Page Edit Toolbars and Buttons | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Html: In-Page Edit Toolbars and Buttons Purpose / Description When a user is logged on and has edit permissions, he should see buttons to edit his content or perform other actions. This is all done in HTML / JavaScript. By default, the server will render this in places defined by the template using placeholders like @Edit.TagToolbar(Content) and similar. Note that usually this HTML is generated by a server-side template, and will usually be wrapped in a if-user-logged-in condition. So if you want to do things differently, here's how - just remember that this is an advanced use case so it's a bit harder than what you're used to with 2sxc :). How to Use The most common use-case is actually to provide some HTML, which the JavaScript will pick up automatically and convert into a menu. The syntax was revised in 2sxc 9.40+, which is what we show here. The previous syntax is still supported, but not recommended any more: <!-- this is the default toolbar for first content item assigned to this module --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"sortOrder\":0,\"useModuleList\":true} }'> </div> <!-- this is a toolbar for a content-item with the id 6875 --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"entityId\":6875} }'> </div> <!-- this could be a custom toolbar for showing a new-button only --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"contentType\":\"BlogPost\",\"action\":\"new\"} }'> </div> <!-- this would have two buttons, each configured in a way --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": [{ \"action\":\"edit\", \"useModuleList\":true, \"sortOrder\": 0, \"prefill\": { \"DocumentedOnPage\": \"page:@Dnn.Tab.TabID\", \"title\": \"@Dnn.Tab.Title\" } }, { \"action\" : \"new\", \"contentType\" : \"BlogPost\" }] }'> </div> What was Changed/Enhanced in 2sxc 9.40 There were some things which worked well, but bothered us as perfectionists :). It boils down to how much of the page html must be different just because editing is used. So this is what we wanted to change: the previous implementation always used a special class sc-element to mark the tag which detects mouse-over. This was necessary, because the tag itself was added in another place in the code. This is not necessary any more, since the sxc-toolbar attribute is now on the tag which does the hover-detect. the previous implementation created a <ul> tag in the source code. Though this was not a big issue, it just didn't feel right. the previous implementation spread the information for the toolbar on two attributes toolbar and settings - this just wasn't perfect. Now it's both in the sxc-toolbar attribute.

Basically what happens is a script picks up all cases of <* sxc-toolbar=...> and <ul class=\"sc-menu ...\"></ul> it will then pass it to a toolbar creator which will either create a standard-list of buttons, or a custom one the resulting buttons/links will be placed in <li> items and added to the <ul> tag But you could also do a whole lot more, including custom buttons and code (since 2sxc 08.06) <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": { \"groups\": [ { \"name\": \"my default list\", \"buttons\": \"edit,add,more\" }, { \"name\": \"list buttons\", \"buttons: \"sort,moveup,movedown,more\" }, { \"name\": \"really advanced stuff\", \"buttons\": [ \"app\", \"zone\", { \"command\":{ \"action\": \"custom\", \"customCode\": \"alert(&apos;hello&apos;)\" } \"icon\": \"icon-sxc-bomb\" }, \"more\" ] } ], \"defaults\": { \"entityId\": 740, \"contentType\": \"BlogPost\" } }}'> ... </div> All the configuration is in the sxc-toolbar attribute, which contains two main nodes: toolbar - see below settings - see Toolbar Settings In the old syntax (before 2sxc 9.40, using the <ul> tag, two attributes are handled toolbar or data-toolbar - see below settings or data-settings - see Toolbar Settings More Background The toolbar information is: an object with some properties (like entityId ) and no action verbs --> then it will auto-generate all default buttons { entityId: 17, isPublished: true } an object with some properties and 1 or more action verbs --> generate only these buttons { actions: \"new,edit\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 1 } an array with commands (objects with 1 verb) --> generate these Buttons [{ action: ...}, { action: ...}] on object containing a buton-group like { buttons: [ { command: { action: ...}}, { command: ...}] } a group of button-groups [ { buttons: ... }, {buttons: ...}] a full toolbar configuration { groups: [...], defaults: {...}, params: {...} } For a full scope of what is possible, you should read the js toolbar documentation .

    "keywords": "JS: Toolbars and Buttons Purpose / Description When a user is logged on and has edit permissions, he should see buttons to edit his content or perform other actions. This is all done in HTML / JavaScript. How to use The most common use-case is actually to provide some HTML, which the JavaScript will pick up automatically and convert into a menu. You can read more about this in Html Toolbars and Buttons . You can also generate the html as needed - for example when working with a javascript template in AngularJS, React, Ember etc. Here's a small example: var btnHtml = $2sxc(740).manage.getButton({ action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }); var toolbarHtml = $2sxc(740).manage.getToolbar({ action: \"new,edit,add\", entityId: 203 }); So this is really it. There are only two commands you must know: ...getButton(...) ...getToolbar(...) The rest of the magic lies in the configuration objects which you pass into these buttons. So let's continue with that. A Deeper Look Inside the System The following terms help you understand what we're doing: 2sxc has many commands like new , edit etc. which you can run with parameters like: command = { action: 'new', contentType: 'BlogPost'}; a button will run such a command when clicked, but for it to work, the button must have the command ready, including the necessary parameters. In JavaScript a button is defined like: btn = { command: { action: \"...\", ...}, icon: \"...\", ... }; and will later be converted to HTML like <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Dummy\"})'>new</a> a button group is an array of buttons, plus some shared specs like group = { buttons: [ { command: ...}, { }, { }], defaults: {...}, ... }; this will later be converted to a list of <li> nodes containing buttons a toolbar contains an array of button groups and again some shared specs / defaults, like toolbar = { groups: [ ... ], defaults: ...}; which will also be converted to the list of <li> nodes, but shows only one group at a time until the user presses a more button The full object tree of a toolbar is fairly sophisticated, and in most cases you can use shorthands which will be expanded internally before use. So you'll write // this is what you would normally write var toolbar = { action: \"new,edit,sort\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 2 }; // which internally expands to this: var toolbar = { groups: [{ buttons: [{ title: \"Toolbar.New\", command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }, icon: \"icon-sxc-plus\", addCondition: true, // more stuff here },{ title: \"Toolbar.Edit\", command: { action: \"edit\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 2 }, icon: \"icon-sxc-pencil\", addCondition: true, // more stuff here }, { // etc. }] }] } In most cases you just care about the shorthand. But in advanced cases where you really want to affect the behavior, you may go want to go deeper. Buttons and Commands Buttons are explained in more details here Commands which run when a button is pressed are here Custom commands which run your JS are here Button group This is just a simple object containing an array of buttons and some more settings which are rarely used and not documented yet. var group = { name: \"...\", buttons: \"...\", defaults: { // ... } }; var group2 = { buttons: [ { action: \"new\" }, { action: \"edit\", icon: \"icon-sxc-bomb\" }, \"button3\", { title: \"hello there\", command: { action: \"new\", } } ], defaults: { // todo } } Toolbar and Toolbar Configuration The toolbar can be defined very precisely, but in most cases you will opt for a short format which is expanded internally. Let's look at it: // very compact version var tb1 = { action: \"new,edit,moveup\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", entityId: 17 }; // array version var tb2 = [{ button1 }, { button2 }] // very expanded edition var tb2 = { groups: [ { name: \"group 1\", buttons: \"new,edit,more\" }, { name: \"group 2\", buttons: \"moveup,movedown,more\" } ], defaults: { contentType: \"BlogPost\", //... } }; Toolbar settings You can customize hover behavior , show behavior and more. Read about it in the toolbar settings . Custom Buttons with Custom Commands You can easily create custom buttons with custom icons, parameters and even custom scripts. It's not well documented yet, but it's best to just look through the tutorial app below. It's also explained more in the Html Custom Code Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App JS Manage / Toolbar API Tutorial App History Introduced in 2sxc v01.00 Public API since 2sxc v08.06"

It enhances the bootstrapping and provides you the syntactical 2sxc goodies in C# known from Razor. Where to Store the API Files All your WebAPIs are C# files saved in the special folder called api . The folder must be in root of your 2sxc app, and the files have to end with ...Controller.cs (this is a convention in ASP.net). New in 2sxc 9.35+ : you can now also create api folders as subfolders to run the api in multiple editions. This is an experimental polymorph feature which is still being worked out, but in general you can use the old and the new way: classic (single edition) [app-folder]/api/YourController.cs accessed url: [api-root]/app/auto/api/[Your] multiple editions: [app-folder]/[edition]/api/YourController.cs access url: [api-root]/app/auto/[edition]/api/[Your] Read more about urls in the WebApi docs. How to use A file named DemoController.cs could look like the following: using DotNetNuke.Security; using DotNetNuke.Web.Api; using ToSic.SexyContent.WebApi; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Web.Http; public class DemoController : SxcApiController { [HttpGet] [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Anonymous)] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public object Get() { return new { Data = Sxc.Serializer.Prepare(App.Data[\"MyData\"].List) }; } } The custom controller DemoController must have the same name as the file and extends the SxcApiController controller. It has a method returning all items of the MyData data type. The method is decorated with several attributes: [HttGet] defines that the method must be invoked with HTTP GET [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = ...)] defines the permission an invoker must have [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] ensures that a security token from the cookies is validated before the mehod is invoked You can implement any other methods. The custom controller can be called with JavaScript and the 2sxc4ng API like this: return $http.get(\"app-api/Demo/Get\").then(function (result) { return results.data.Data; }); The 2sxc4ng API ensures that the GET request is send to the correct url /DesktopModules/2sxc/API/app-api/Demo/Get. You can also read more about the jQuery sxc Controller to use 2sxc-WebApis from jQuery pages. Special Object / Commands in SxcApiController The SxcApiController provides various command / helpers to get you productiv. Most are the same as in a normal Razor view, but some are additional. Here are the main ones: AsDynamic(...) AsEntity(...) Dnn App with App.Data , App.Query etc. Data SaveInAdam(...) new in 9.30 ## Notes Instead of App.Data[\"MyData\"] you can fetch data from another data source provided by 2sxc (for exmple from the App.Query[\"MyQueryData\"] ) Sxc.Serializer.Prepare(...) converts the object returned by App.Data[\"MyData\"].List to a dynamic and serializable object Read also WebApi Concepts: Polymorphisms History Introduced in 2sxc 06.05 Enhanced with Polymorph Editions in 2sxc 9.35 (allowing subfolder/api)"

    "title": "Http WebAPI and REST API | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Http WebAPI and REST API note that this documentation is for 2sxc 8.10+. Previous versions aready support most of these features with a different URL which still works, but those URLs are deprecated for the future. Purpose / Description The WebApi is a set of http APIs which let you access content-items, lists of items, queries or even custom c# APIs. You can find some jQuery examples on the $2sxc-WebApi page . For example, assume you have the blog-app installed and your JS would request a JSON from this endpoint (logged in as host, so security is not an issue): [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost ...then your JS would receive a JSON with all BlogPost items. More examples: Reading this: [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost/1050 ...would give you exactly one BlogPost item (with the id 1050). Doing an http POST to this [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost/1050 ... with a POST body of { \"Title\": \"changed title\"} ...would let you update the item 1050. This kind of a call [root-path]/app/auto/query/BlogPostsByAuthor?Author=Daniel%20Mettler ...would run the pre-defined query and return the Blog Posts of this author Understanding URLs for In-Context vs. External Use In most cases your JS will be part of your App, so it will be running inside a 2sxc-template. In this case, you can rely on auto-detection of the app, like .../app/auto/content/... There are also cases where you want to access the app REST or WebApi from outside of the app itself. This can be from the skin (for example, to highlight all words to which your glossary-app has definitions), from another app, or from another website. In this case, auto-app detection won't work, so you'll have to specify the app-name (folder-name) in the request-path, like this: .../app/Glossary/content/... This applies to all endpoints like content , query , api . Available Endpoints in 2sxc 8.10+ Query The Query endpoint can be accessed on .../app/auto/query/[your-query-name] when you're accessing a query of the current App (from a dnn-page with this module), as then 2sxc uses auto-detect .../app/[app-folder]/query/[your-query-name] using this endpoint from external (other module, other page, other website) as then auto-detect can't work. Note that Query endpoints only support the http-verb GET. C# WebAPI Endpoints C# / .net WebApis are custom WebAPIs of an app. You can find a good example on the Mobius Forms App . Calling these is as follows: .../app/auto/api/[YourName] when accessing a WebApi of the current app (from a dnn-page with this module), as then 2sxc uses auto-detect .../app/[app-folder]/api/[YourName] when using this endpoint from external, as auto-detect can't work then. New in 9.35: Polymorphism / Multi-Edition Controllers In 2sxc 9.35 we're introducing an experimental feature to publish the same api controller in multiple editions, to enable open-heart-surgery. It's called Polymorph , and if you use it to place controllers in a subfolder/api you'll access it as follows: .../app/auto/[edition]/api/[YourName] when accessing from a 2sxc-module directly with auto-detect .../app/[app-folder]/[edition]/api/[YourName] when auto-detect can't work (external access). Read more about Polymorph and C# WebApi . WebAPI Security / Permissions Your C# code determines what security is applied, and what http verbs are supported. Content Items Services The content-items services support all common REST verbs .../app/auto/content/[YourContentType] - GET (retrieve list) .../app/auto/content/[your-content-type]/[item-id] - GET (get one), POST (create/update), DELETE (delete) .../app/auto/content/[your-content-type]/[item-guid] - GET (get one), POST (create/update), DELETE (delete) Note that when using this endpoint from external, you'll have to replace auto with the app name as it is used in the folder of the app (not the nice, translatable/visible app-name). Content Security / Permissions Security / Permissions are configured at the content-type level, in the App-Management UI. How it works todo Notes and Clarifications Basically every call to these paths will simply return what you expect, or perform what you want Note that for most actions some security rules will apply, for example: reading data requires read-permissions on that content-type writing data requires write-permissions or a content-type or on a specific item (owner-permissions) querying a query requires read-permissions on that query querying a web-api requires the web-api to have its own permission check In DNN 9, the root-path for api changed! DNN 7 & 8: [portal-root with language]/desktopmodules/2sxc/api/... DNN 9: [portal-root with language]/api/2sxc/...

By default, this context is already provided by the environment, but sometimes a new context must provide overrides. This is rare, but important, for example using Concept: Inner Content 2.0 . So the ContextAttributes will provide this information in some hidden html. How to use This example shows the title and will add the standard editing-buttons for the Content item. Here's an Concept: Inner Content 2.0 example: <div class=\"app-blog-text sc-content-block-list\" @Edit.ContextAttributes(post, field: \"DesignedContent\")> @foreach(var cb in @post.DesignedContent) { @cb.Render(); } </div> In this example, the Edit.ContextAttributes will add some attributes with JSON, which will help the toolbars inside that loop to correctly edit those items, and not the main item around it. How it works The Edit.ContextAttributes(...) is always used inside an HTML-tag and will add some attributes with JSON. Any buttons or actions inside that tag will then find this information, and assume that it is has precendence over the global information. Using ContextAttributes These context-attributes enhance an HTML-tag, so that buttons inside that tag can be in a different context than the original context. Here's a common example: imagine you have a 2sxc-instance (a module showing 2sxc-data) and all the buttons there know the App-ID, the Zone, the Content-Type etc. Inside this module, you can have multiple items but they all still work well in the original context (all items are in the same app, so an edit-dialog will also know the AppId). The parameters target required the content-item for which the new context should be. this item usually has a field (see the next property) which has Concept: Inner Content 2.0 field string the field of this content-item, which contains the inner-content-items contentType string this should not be used yet, it's for a future feature Notes and Clarifications Enforced Parameter Naming To promote long term API stability, we require all parameters except for the first content-item target to be named when used - see convention . <!-- this will work --> @Edit.ContextAttributes(target: postItem, field: \"InnerContent\") <!-- this won't work --> @Edit.ContextAttributes(postItem, \"InnerContent\") Read also About Inner Content Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Blog App History Introduced in 2sxc 8.4 Declaration HtmlString ContextAttributes(IDynamicEntity target, string dontRelyOnParameterOrder = \"random-y023n\", string field = null, string contentType = null, Guid? newGuid = default(Guid? )) Parameters Type Name Description IDynamicEntity target the object for is part of the context System.String dontRelyOnParameterOrder this is just to ensure you will use named params for any other param System.String field the field name - in case of list-contexts System.String contentType type name for new items - usually for inner-content and list-contexts System.Nullable < System.Guid > newGuid the guid of a new item - use null for auto-generate Returns Type Description System.Web.HtmlString | Improve this Doc View Source Enable(String, Nullable<Boolean>, Nullable<Boolean>, Nullable<Boolean>, Nullable<Boolean>, Nullable<Boolean>) Ensure that the UI will load the correct assets to enable editing Declaration string Enable(string dontRelyOnParameterOrder = \"random-y023n\", bool? api = default(bool? ), bool? forms = default(bool? ), bool? context = default(bool? ), bool? autoToolbar = default(bool? ), bool? styles = default(bool? )) Parameters Type Name Description System.String dontRelyOnParameterOrder System.Nullable < System.Boolean > api if JS etc. should be included to enable editing API System.Nullable < System.Boolean > forms System.Nullable < System.Boolean > context If context should be added, to ensure in-instance data editing System.Nullable < System.Boolean > autoToolbar System.Nullable < System.Boolean > styles Returns Type Description System.String null - but we wanted to make sure it returns something, so you can use it in razor like @Edit.EnableUi() | Improve this Doc View Source TagToolbar(Object, String, String, String, Object, Object, Object) Generate a toolbar attribute inside an html-tag Declaration HtmlString TagToolbar(object target = null, string dontRelyOnParameterOrder = \"random-y023n\", string actions = null, string contentType = null, object prefill = null, object toolbar = null, object settings = null) Parameters Type Name Description System.Object target The item this toolbar is for, can be null System.String dontRelyOnParameterOrder Special parameter to force named-parameters for any other setting System.String actions list of actions on this toolbar, null means default actions for this item System.String contentType content-type of this toolbar, used when it offers new/add buttons System.Object prefill prefill information, for new items System.Object toolbar complex manual toolbar configuration if needed - providing this will cause actions to be ignored System.Object settings toolbar settings controlling hover etc. Returns Type Description System.Web.HtmlString If the user is an editor, it returns the attribute containing all the toolbar configuration | Improve this Doc View Source Toolbar(Object, String, String, String, Object, Object, Object) Generate a toolbar tag - must be used in normal html, not as an attribute Declaration HtmlString Toolbar(object target = null, string dontRelyOnParameterOrder = \"random-y023n\", string actions = null, string contentType = null, object prefill = null, object toolbar = null, object settings = null) Parameters Type Name Description System.Object target The item this toolbar is for, can be null System.String dontRelyOnParameterOrder Special parameter to force named-parameters for any other setting System.String actions list of actions on this toolbar, null means default actions for this item System.String contentType content-type of this toolbar, used when it offers new/add buttons System.Object prefill prefill information, for new items System.Object toolbar complex manual toolbar configuration if needed - providing this will cause actions to be ignored System.Object settings toolbar settings controlling hover etc. Returns Type Description System.Web.HtmlString If the user is an editor, it returns HTML UL tag containing all the toolbar configuration"

    "title": "Concept: DNN/Evoq Page Versioning / Publishing and Workflow | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Concept: DNN/Evoq Page Versioning / Publishing and Workflow This page explains how a DNN / Evoq does page versioning and workflow, and how to leverage this with 2sxc. Background: DNN / Evoq Page/Module Versioning DNN / Evoq had a few different ways of doing versioning, but since DNN 7.4.2 it basically uses a model which works as follows: Each page has a live version number (for this demo we'll say version P27 - for page 27). On this page, various modules exist, each having their own version number. Let's say we have a gallery-module which is currently on version 6 (MG6) and a module with a form in version 12 (MF12). So the page information currently has: P27 live Module 1: MG6 live Module 2: MF12 live Basic Example with Adding Module If a new module with a form is added in between, DNN will do the following P28 draft (P27 is still live ) Mod 1: MG6 live (same version on live and draft ) Mod 2: MF1 new , regarded as draft Mod 3: MF13 draft (the position has changed, so the module info has changed) As further changes to modules additions / removals / reordering happen, this happens on the P28 version only. So even if we delete or rename a module, the live version will not show this. So DNN mechanims incl. moving/renaming of modules is a DNN/Evoq responsiblity, and is versioned by DNN/Evoq. We'll talk about the internal content of a module further down. Publishing a Page Basically when an editor publishes a page, DNN will do the following: set P28 to the published page tell each module to publish in that version (in case the module support inner versioning - read on...) DNN / Evoq Workflows Because these topics are almost undocumented - and exist in different implementations, they are confusing. You need to know the following about workflows: Workflows apply to the page only, so pages need to know if they have a workflow and which one Modules don't know about these workflows... ...because Modules only get notified when the workflow reaches a \"publish\" state Background: Module Inside/Inner Versioning Modules have their own content which may or may not be versioned. 99% of all modules don't version their content and have no history. And 99.9% don't support DNN/Evoq page versions & publishing . So IF a module doesn't know about these mechanisms, then changes inside that module will not be versioned and they will be live immediately as they are applied. But let's assume our modules do support this, and let's say the gallery with module-info in V6 (it was moved a few times, so it has 6 versions) still has the initial V1 content, which we'll call MGi1 (Module Gallery inside V1). Module Version Tree with Inner Version So let's look at the versioning tree as it really is P27 live Mod 1: MG6 live with MGi1 Mod 2: MF12 live with MFi26 (had made configuration changes, each versioned) Now let's simulate a change... Inner Content Changes Let's say the editor makes a small change to the Form-module. This will notify DNN of a change. As this happens, it must tell DNN that it has a new version - like this, so DNN will also place the page in a new version (for later publishing): P28 draft Mod 1: MG6 live with MGi1 live Mod 2: MF12 live with MFi27 draft Note that if the form module makes more changes, it can choose to report this or not, since basically the newest version is a draft already, on a draft-page. Inner Content Publishing Now once the user decides to publish this page, each module (incl. the Forms-Module) will be notified to publish it's version. DNN will tell the form which version it should publish (in this case v27). The form must take care of whatever processing to ensure that this version is now live / public. 2sxc Support for DNN / Evoq Publishing 2sxc support the core parts of DNN/Evoq Publishing and versioning. To be more specific, it will detect if the page requires a publishing workflow tell DNN/Evoq that on-page content was edited modify the GUI to only allow draft/publish options as it corresponds with the page information listen to DNN/Evoq messages to publish on-page information This sounds simple, but it's very complex because 2sxc can be used in many scenarios, and in some it's not always clear when to draft or publish something. So there are some exceptions, which are documented below. Activating Page Publishing Feature on 2sxc You don't have to do anything - 2sxc asks the environment (DNN/Evoq) it it expects any publishing steps, and will automatically adjust its behavoir. Making Changes Start a DNN-Page Versioning This too happens automatically, if the page has a publishing setup in DNN/Evoq. Auto-Draft and Auto-Publish explained To be sure you understand what's going on, please note the following: Only changes which directly relate to a page cause auto-draft / auto-publish Example 1: A user changes a blog post on a blog-page. The page will get a new draft version and the live blog will show the old one, while the draft will show the new one. When the page is published, the draft will become live. Changes to content-items which are not directly tied to a page, will not cause drafting / publishing Example 2: When the user edits the blog post he also creates another category (which is used as data and not as on-page content). This category is immediately live, but will probably not show up as it's only used in the edited blog-post. Example 3: An admin-user goes into the admin UI and creates a blog post from within the admin-UI. It will not auto-default to draft , as this is not specific to any page. But if the user manually sets it to draft, it will be published when a page showing it is released. Restoring Previous Versions DNN / Evoq has a mechanism for restoring previous page versions, and when implemented perfectly, all modules inside it could also revert back to the state it was in at that time. Such a perfect world is hard to implement and nearly impossible in a dynamic-content setup. For example, apps may have been deleted or content-types (schemas) may have changed. So the idea sounds good, but is impossible to implement correctly. So 2sxc goes the pragmatic way: You can restore any item to a previous version - so you can always roll back a blog-post to a previous copy, but putting the page back into an old version will not roll back anything inside a 2sxc-module. To Restore previous versions of content-items, use the history (clock) icon in the toolbar. Technical Deep Dive - Behind the Scenes In case you run into trouble or need to know more about the mechanisms, here's what you need to know What is an On-Page Change and What is Not By definition, any item created or modified directly from a toolbar button in the front end is regarded as an On-Page change and will start the page-draft process. This is basically all the buttons which normal (non-admin) users see. If you haven't heard of hiding admin-buttons, please read the concept on hiding advanced features . Specifically, this includes the following actions: editing content directly from a toolbar button adding new content to the page from a toolbar button moving items up/down in a content-item list using a toolbar button replacing an item on a page using the toolbar button The following actions are not regarded as on-page changes, and don't auto-force drafting: editing any data from the Admin-UI editing app-resources or app-settings creating / modifying views importing data / importing apps What is Published on Page-Publish and What Not When a page is published, DNN/Evoq will tell each module that it should now publish that specific version assigned to that page version. When this happens, 2sxc does the following: Retrieves the (usually invisible/secret) content-group entity which contains the information, what template and what items are shown on this module. This one is probably stored as a draft from previous changes, as this one keeps track of the items to show and the order to show them in. This draft is then published. Reviews all items on the four primary in-streams, checks each entity and publishes draft versions. The streams it will process are: Default (this is the one provided on Content) Presentation ListContent (the header-content item) ListPresentation (the header presentation item) Note that other streams are not auto-published. This is to prevent side-effects. For example, a Blog-View could have additional streams to visualize authors, categories etc. but these will not be auto-published, as it is assumed that these are helper-data and not specifically on-page data for this page. Publishing Additional Items If you want to auto-publish additional items, just add them to a stream PartOfPage . Inner Content Handling (Very Rich Content) Inner Content is not currently treated as belonging to the page, as it is inside content which is already drafted/published. So inner-content is always published when created. Note that this is not fully tested/implemented, you may have unexpected consequences when working with inner content. Image And Asset Handling Images and assets are not versioned / published, as DNN provides no effective way to enable this. So as of now, the following will happen: if a content-type has a file-field using ADAM with a single file (not library), then draging in an additional file will behave like the publishing, because the new file has a new number, and this is not in use till the item is published if the user drags in an updated file with the same name, it will internally receive a number at the end, and also stay unpublished, as it's a different file on the server if a user manually replaces a file (not drag-drop in ADAM) or deletes a file and then uploads the file with the same name, then this file is live, as it really changed the file on the server if you are using a library-field in ADAM (often used in galleries), then these files are automatically live as well, and deleted files are also removed immediately In case you are using an ADAM library and would like to only show the files which existed before you created an unpublished draft, this can be done in your template. Just remember that certain changes (like file-changes on the server) could change the modified date, and that deleting files also really removes live files as well. Here's how you can change your Razor: @* before, showing all files *@ @foreach(var pic in AsAdam(Content, \"Files\").Files) { <span>@pic.FileName, @pic.LastModificationTime</span><br> } @* only showing \"older\" files *@ @foreach(var pic in ((IEnumerable<ToSic.SexyContent.Adam.AdamFile>)AsAdam(Content, \"Files\").Files).Where(f => f.LastModificationTime <= Content.Modified)) { <span>@pic.FileName, @pic.LastModificationTime</span><br> } Notes and Clarifications As mentioned, this is the default setup. In the case of data-oriented apps, which query data from somewhere, you may have other expectations. At the moment there is no additional mechanism to customize this any further, but we believe that you can easily cover all possible scenarios with this setup.

    "href": "specs/cms/tokens.html",
    "title": "Concept: Tokens | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Concept: Tokens Often you need a text-based code which should be replaced at runtime with a real value from elsewhere. In DNN / 2sxc this is called a token , and they usually look like [Source:Property] . At runtime, this will then show a value like 27 . Note: this article applies to tokens as they are handled server-side. There is a special token-like syntax in JavaScript, which is not discussed here. Token Basics A token is a piece of text that looks like [Source:Property] , which will be replaced by an engine so that it will then be a value. For example, [QueryString:Page] is replaced with 2 if the current url has ?page=2 in it. You can research more about tokens in older docs here and in the full list of standard tokens , it's a standard DNN concept. Additional Token Features in 2sxc/EAV The EAV and 2sxc have enhanced Tokens to a new level with these features: 1. Sub-Tokens A token like [App:Settings:PageSize] will go through a tree of info-objects to find an inner property if it exists. This only works on special object types that are specifically meant to provide sub-data. 2. Fallback A token like [QueryString:page||1] will deliver the url-param, and if that is empty, will deliver 1 . Note that you need 2 pipe symbols | because the convention is that after the first pipe you can have a format specifier like #.## . 3. Stacking Stacking with more Tokens: a token like [QueryString:PageSize||[App:Settings:PageSize]] will try the first token, and if it doesn't resolve, try the next one 4. Recursion A token can resolve into a token, which would then be looked up again. So if a token [Settings:Page||1] is used, and the setting Page is not a number but again a token like [QueryString:Page] , then it will... resolve Settings:Page and find Querystring:Page resolve QueryString:Page and maybe find something if that is empty, return the fallback 1 Some Token Examples [Portal:PortalId] would return the current portal Id [App:Settings:PageSize] would return the page size as configured in app-settings [QueryString:Id] would retrieve the id-parameter from the url (note: you should never put this in your data source) [Settings:ProductId] would retrieve the id as configured in the UI by the user [Settings:productId||27] would also try to get the id, but return 27 if not found Advanced Token Sources in Special Scenarios Some situations will have token sources beyond the default. For example, when configuring data sources they always have 2 more sources In - used like [In:Default:PageSize] Settings - used like [Settings:PageSize] There is another special override-token system (not documented) which is used for testing For more on this, read the DataSource Configuration section.

Storage in the SQL Database in the EAV-Model This is stored in a special relationships-table, so internally the current DB IDs are used to track relationships. Storage in the SQL Database in the JSON-Model This is stored as an array of strings, which contain the GUIDs of the related information. Specials of the Entity type: The entity-type has these specials it's good to know about It's always a list It preserves the relationship order Special #1: It's always a List Since it could contain 1 or many items (and the configuration can change whenever you want), reading it always means reading a list. So you'll always use something like this (C#): // full name of author var fn = Book.Author[0].FullName; // in case you're not sure if the author was added or null, you can do var fn2 = (Book.Author.Any() ? Book.Author[0].FirstOrDefault : \"\"); // This will also work in newer versions of C# // making fullName either the name, or a null var fn3 = Book.Author.FirstOrDefault()?.FullName; // the following won't work! var wontWork = Book.Author.FullName; // this won't work Or the same in JavaScript: var fn = Book.Author[0].FullName; // in case you're not sure if it has any // this uses the JS-syntax which returns the last-value of an && condition var fn = Book.Author && Book.Author[0].FullName; Special #2: It preserves Order If the user said a book has 2 authors: Daniel Abraham Then it's sometimes usefull to preserve the order - in this case Daniel was probably the main author and Abraham helped out a bit. To allow for this, the Entity field will keep the order of items as they were added. Side-effect: Sometimes you want to have an A-Z order when showing items. As the order is not auto-sorted, you will have to do this yourself if you want to have them sorted. Use LINQ to do that.

Special: Automatic Conversions The hyperlink data internally can contain values like: http://whatever/whatever - will not be converted /some-relative-url - will not be converted page:42 - will usually be converted to the real url of the page in DNN page:42?something=value - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters page:42#something=value - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters file:2750 - will usually be converted to the real url of the file in DNN file:2750?w=200 - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters (like for thumbnails) file:2750#page=2 - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters (like for pdf-page-links) In 99% of all use cases, you want to generate html with a real link, which is why the content-objects in Razor will deliver an http:... instead of file:27 .

The ConfigMask builds a configuration token which will be used to get this setting, and also ensures that cachings mechanims vary the cache based on the result of the configuration. How to use ConfigMask Here's a simple example of the constructor of the DnnFormAndList DataSource , which expects 3 settings: public DnnFormAndList() { // Specify what out-streams this data-source provides. Usually just one, called \"Default\" Provide(GetList); // Register the configurations we want as tokens, so that the values will be injected later on ConfigMask(\"ModuleId\", \"[Settings:ModuleId||0]\"); ConfigMask(\"TitleField\", \"[Settings:TitleFieldName]\"); ConfigMask(\"ContentType\", \"[Settings:ContentTypeName||FnL]\"); } This example adds 3 configuration masks - let's find out what exactly happens. Tokens for Configuration Injection The EAV-System has a sophisticated system to get configuration based on tokens. You can read about configuration injection using tokens here . Registering and Resolving these Tokens with ConfigMask Internally a lot happens, but you just need to know the ConfigMask command.

    "keywords": "Guide to Working with LINQ and 2sxc/EAV Data Warning: some of this is old and doesn't apply any more we must update these docs Especially the compare / contains etc. actually works now, even with dyn-objects In many cases you will want to sort, filter or group some data, or quickly check if any data was found. When using Razor or working in WebApi, this is best done with LINQ. This guide will assist you to get everything working. For a more API-oriented documentation, see DotNet Query LINQ . We also recommend to play around with the Razor Tutorial App LINQ Basics The way LINQ works is that the namespace System.Linq contains a bunch of extension methods like .Count() , .Where(...) and more. So to use LINQ you need to add a @using statement to razor or just using in a WebApi class. Here's a simple razor example: @using System.Linq; @{ var newestPosts = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"BlogPost\"]) .OrderByDescending(b => b.PublicationDate) .Take(3); } This demonstrates: adding the using statement getting all the BlogPost items using App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] converting it to a list of dynamic objects which will allow the nice syntax using AsDynamic(...) sorting these with newest on top using .OrderByDescending(...) on the property PublicationDate keeping only the first 3 using .Take(3) it also shows how placing the parts on separate lines makes the code easier to read Important: Working with LINQ and dynamic objects LINQ needs IEnumerable<...> Before we continue, it's important that you really understand that LINQ commands are stored as extension methods of IEnumerable<T> . So this works: @using System.Linq; @{ var list = new List<string> { \"word\", \"word\" }; var x = list.First(); } ...whereas this does not: @using System.Linq; @{ var y = 27.First(); } This sounds obvious, but there's an important catch: if the compiler doesn't know that something is an IEnumerable , it will not even try to use the LINQ extension methods, because it doesn't know that it can. So let's look at that... LINQs Problems with dynamic objects #1 Here's an example that would fail: @using System.Linq; @{ dynamic list = new List<string> { \"word\", \"word\" }; var x = list.First(); } The only difference to before is that list ist now dynamic . It contains the same object, but the compiler doesn't treat it that way. In Razor, we use dynamic objects all the time, where we run into this problem. Here's an example which fails: @using System.Linq; @{ var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !b.Authors.Any()); } Internally the b.Authors returns a list of authors, but the compiler doesn't know this, since it's treated as a dynamic object. You would get an error. To solve this, we must tell the compiler that b.Authors is an IEnumerable, like this: @using System.Linq; @using System.Collections.Generic; @{ var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !(b.Authors as IEnumerable<dynamic>).Any()); } But let's be honest - it's ugly, long and prone to typos. Especially in a complex query where you could have many of these. So we recommend to define a shorthand for it, like this: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !(b.Authors as Dynlist).Any()); } LINQs problem with dynamic objects #2 LINQ methods often have multiple signatures. This means the same command can be written in different ways and with different parameters. To detect the right method, the compiler needs to know the data-types used in the parameters. This causes problem with dynamic objects because the compiler doesn't know what it is until runtime. Check this out: @using System.Linq; @{ var dogString = \"dog\" dynamic dogDyn = \"dog\"; var list = new List<string> { \"dog\", \"cat\", \"hound\" }; var x = list.Contains(dogString); // this works var x = list.Contains(dogDyn); // this fails } To fix this, we must tell the compiler it's an object: @using System.Linq; @{ dynamic dynDog = \"dog\"; var list = new List<string> { \"dog\", \"cat\", \"hound\" }; var x = list.Contains(dynDog as object); } The above example is a bit trivial but here's a real life example, taken from the 2sxc razor tutorial : @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ var persons = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Persons\"]); var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithAwardedAuthors = books .Where(b => (b.Authors as Dynlist) .SelectMany(a => a.Awards as Dynlist) .Any() ); var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(b as object) ); } LINQs problem with dynamic object #3 The last bit has to do with how dynamic objects are built, since they are usually wrapper-objects to help write nicer template code. As wrappers, they are different objects every time. This shows the problem: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ // this is just the data object, \"@bookData.Author\" wouldn't work var bookData1 = App.Data[\"Books\"].First(); var bookData2 = App.Data[\"Books\"].First(); // this is now a dynamic object, allowing @bookDyn1.Author\" var bookDyn1 = AsDynamic(bookData1); var bookDyn2 = AsDynamic(bookData2); var dataIsSame = bookData1 == bookData2; // true var dynIsSame = bookDyn1 == bookDyn2; // false before 2sxc 9.42 } This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is. Look at this code from the example above: var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(b as object) ); The .Contains(...) clause receives a variable b which is actually the dynamic wrapper, and will not be the same as the dynamic wrapper of dynamic wrappers given in booksWithAwardedAuthors . So contains would always say \"nope, didn't find it\". Solving the comparison / equality problem requires the underlying wrapper object to tell the .net framework, that == , != and a few internal methods must work differently. 2sxc 9.42 does this, so the above code would actually work in 2sxc 9.42, but not in previous versions. If another system gives you dynamic objects, you will probably have to write it like this: // this example is for non-2sxc objects or 2sxc before 9.42 var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(bookWithAward => bookWithAward != null && bookWithAward.SomeProperty == b.SomeProperty) ); LINQs problem with boolean null-objects In many cases, dynamic objects could have a property like Show which could be a boolean, but it could also be null . So this could cause an error: var show = links.Where(x => x.Show); To fix this, the easiest way is to really compare it with true or false as you want, each way will result in treating the null as the opposite (so you decide if null should be yes or no): @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; Dynlist list; list = links.Where(x => x.Show == true); // take true, skip false & null list = links.Where(x => x.Show != true); // take false & null, skip true list = links.Where(x => x.Show == false); // take false, skip true & null list = links.Where(x => x.Show != false); // take true & null, skip false list = links.Where(x => x.Show == null); // take null, skip true & false Read also, Demo App and further links LINQ API Docs Razor Tutorial App showing all kinds of Queries History Guide created 2019-03"

    "keywords": "All DataSource Objects in 2sxc / EAV Purpose / Description 2sxc provides a large set of DataSource objects which either get data from somewhere (SQL, CSV, ...) or modify data on the In and passing it to Out . This page will give you an overview and link you to further sources if you need to know more. How to use Many data-sources are simply used in the Visual Query , and if all you want is visual-query, then this reference will give you an overview regarding what things are possible. It will usually look like this: If on the other hand you want to program with these DataSource objects, then it will usually look a bit like this: An example code // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Author\"; // Sort by FullName var sortedAuthors = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthors.Attributes = \"FullName\"; The previous example creates an initial source allAuthors which has all data on the in, then filters to only provide those of type Author to the out. This is then piped to the sortedAuthors , which sorts on the Attributes field. Understanding Data-Flow and Configuration This is explained in the DataSource documentation . All Public DataSources These are all the data sources which are either provided in the default installation of 2sxc, or which are available for you to install (manually). Data Source Purpose Description & Details App Organize Provides each content-type on the out-stream (...) Provides each content-type on the out-stream, so that you can use ds[\"any-type-name\"] as if there was a table for each type. AttributeFilter Modify Removes properties on the entities (...) Removes properties on the entities, typically before you stream it to JSON, so that only the fields you want are transmitted. BaseCache (internal) Base class (...) The base class for all system caches (QuickCache, FarmCache, etc.) BaseCache code BaseDataSource (internal) Base class (...) This is just a base class. BaseDataSource code CacheAllStreams Caching Cache all streams passing through (...) Every stream on this \"In\" are also available on the \"Out\" but cached a certain amount of time or till the upstream source is invalidated. ContentTypeFilter EntityTypeFilter Filter Only items of a specific content-type (...) Returns only items which are of a certain content-type. Note: was previously called EntityTypeFilter. CsvDataSource Get Data Get data from a CSV-file (...) Lets you read a CSV file and provide the data as Entities for further use. not well documented yet, see code here ToSic.Eav.DataSources.CsvDataSource DataTable DataSource Get Data Base class for coding only (...) Lets you convert a .net DataTable object into a DataSource. This is great for when you find it easier to generate a DataTable, and this will auto-provide it as a stream. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataTableDataSource DataTable DataSource code Deferred Pipeline Query (internal) Internal object to optimize performance (...) This is used internally, because it will auto-generate an entire query-pipeline from configuration and query it, but only if accessed. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DeferredPipelineQuery Deferred Pipeline Query code Dnn FormAndList Get Data Use old FnL data in 2sxc (...) Will let you access Form-And-List aka UDT (Universal Data Table) data. ToSic.SexyContent.Environment.Dnn7. DataSources.DnnFormAndList Dnn FormAndList code DnnSql DataSource Get Data DNN Sql DataSource (...) SqlDataSource which only uses the DNN DB and nothing else, based on the SqlDataSource DnnUserProfile DataSource Get Data Get DNN Users and profiles (...) Get DNN users and profiles to create user directories, details-pages etc. ToSic.SexyContent.Environment.Dnn7. not well documented, check out the source code here DataSources.DnnUserProfileDataSource ExternalData DataSource (internal) Base Class for external data DataSources (...) This is a base-class for all kinds of external data sources (like Csv…) because it provides more information related to enabling cachning etc. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ExternalDataDataSource ExternalData DataSource code ItemIdFilter EntityIdFilter Filter One or more items with an Id (...) Return only 0, 1 or more items which fit the IDs in the string provided. Previously named EntityIdFilter ItemFilterDuplicates Logic Find and remove OR retrieve duplicate items (...) Use this to remove duplicates or just find them (or both) Module-Instance DataSource Get Data Get current modules data (...) Will get the content-items assigned to a DNN-Module. This is used internally on each view, but can also be used when using module-data to configure a query. OwnerFilter Filter Only items which are \"owned\" by a user (...) Returns only items which are \"owned\" = created by a specific person. Great for tools where the users have their own data / registrations which they can still modify. Paging Logic Page through items (...) Returns only a specific amount of items after skiping another amount; also provides a stream telling you how many items / pages are in the stream, to let you assemble a pager UI element PassThrough (internal) Do-Nothing DataSource (...) This data source doesn't actually do anything - it just lets the data on the in to the out. For (internal) and testing stuff. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.PassThrough PassThrough code PublishingFilter Filter Filters items the current user shouldn't see (...) This is part of the \"Unpublished-Data\" concept. Since each item could be either published or draft, this helps you show the correct ones for the current user based on his edit-rights. It's automatically in the default pipeline, unless you explicitly don't want it. QuickCache (internal) Internal cache class (...) The quick and simple cache used by default internally. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Caches.QuickCache QuickCache code RelationshipFilter Filter Filter items which have a relationship (...) This helps you find items which are related to another item - like \"All Books by Author Daniel Mettler\" New in 8.12: In-Stream \"Fallback\" which is returned if the filter didn't return any hits. SqlDataSource Get Data Get SQL data as entities (...) This lets you get data from any SQL data base. It also has powerful script-injection protection, so messy parameters won't hurt it. Shuffle Logic Shuffle/randomize item order (...) This source mixes up the order of the items, typically for things like \"show 3 random quotes\" StreamFallback Logic Returns the first in-stream with results (...) Use this to choose from multiple in-streams which data to show. It will use all the in-streams sorted A-Z, and return the first stream which can deliver data. The remaining streams will not be queried. StreamMerge Logic Merge all in-stream into 1 (...) Use this to merge multiple in-streams into one output stream. ValueFilter Filter Filters by value (...) Returns all items where a specified property matches the filter. Very powerfull, with filters like contains, between, etc. New in 8.12: In-Stream \"Fallback\" which is returned if the filter didn't return any hits. ValueSort Sort Sorts all items (...) Sorts the items in the stream asc/desc based on a property. ViewDataSource (internal) Internal class for view-handling (...) This is technically just the target of a pipeline, which is then routed to the Razor/Token View. Basically just does a full pass-through.

It supports touch and usually is used with a mouseover. In the current version, it allows you to do the following in normal view-mode: add a content or app module on any position in a DNN panes move / delete any DNN module using a copy-paste concept send any DNN module to an empty pane (which couldn't do paste, as the target is invisible) add a content or app content-block to any inner-content area move / delete any content-block inside an inner-content area Since version 2.0 you can also configure some of this at skin and template level. How to use By default any page that has any 2sxc module added will automatically load quickE because it needs it to provide buttons/toolbars for inner content blocks. We also recommend to include the JS in the skin by default, so that quickE is already enabled on empty pages as well. You can find the necessary asp.net web-control in our Bootstrap Instant Theme Here's how: <%@ Register tagprefix=\"Edit\" tagname=\"QuickEdit\" src=\"~/DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent/DnnWebForms/Skins/QuickEdit.ascx\" %> <Edit:QuickEdit runat=\"server\" /> The above lines first tell .net that this control QuickEdit exists, and then adds it to the page using the <Edit:...> tag. Note that this tag won't create any HTML, it will just tell DNN that it must load the relevant JavaScripts when a user is logged on. Once it's included, it will just work automatically. Auto-Disabled Module-Quick-Edit on Details Pages By default quickE will change it's behavior if it finds inner-content blocks. The reason is that often inner-blocks are found on child pages of something, for example in blog-post details. If the user could insert both modules and inner-content on a details page, then the user would often by accident insert modules (instead of content-blocks). The user would believe that he did the right thing, when in reality the newly added module would now show up on all other details-pages as well. Now there are cases where this auto-disable shouldn't happen - for example in accordeon-style modules which are used on normal pages. This can be configured as explained below: Configuring quickE Quick-Edit Since quickE 2.0 (released in 2sxc 8.7) you can now also configure it a bit.

    "keywords": "@Edit.Toolbar(...) Method in Razor / .net 2sxc has a cool in-page toolbar system - here you'll find a conceptual overview around the toolbar . These toolbars are usually hover-buttons like this: Technically the entire Edit-UI is JavaScript based, so all the buttons, events etc. are client side scripts. Writing this JS would be complicated to say the least, so the @Edit.TagToolbar(...) and @Edit.Toolbar(...) are your tools of choice for adding toolbars from Razor. How to use Here's a quick example of using the Edit object in a Razor template: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> This example will output the item title in an h1 tag and add a hidden, appear-on-mouse-over toolbar with editing-buttons for the item named Content . Let's assume you're building the details-page of a news-app and you only want the edit/remove buttons, to improve the UI for your use case. Additionally, you want the mouse-hover to react on the whole article, not just oven the title. Here's how: @* this will show an \"edit and remove\" button for the current item *@ <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, actions: \"edit,remove\")> <h1> @Content.Title </h1> @Html.Raw(Content.Body) </div> Here's a different example, how to create a toolbar with only one button, namely an add new item button to create a new BlogPost-item. @* this will show an \"add\" button if the current user is an editor *@ <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\")> @Content.Title </h1> As you can see, the actions: \"new\" tells the toolbar to only show this one button, while the contentType: \"BlogPost\" says what content-type this new item should be. As this toolbar won't have buttons that modify an existing item, it doesn't need that parameter. How it works This command is part of the Edit object and used in Razor templates. It provides a simple API to generate in-page buttons if the current user is an editor. It also checks if edit should be enabled (based on security specs) and will then generate some HTML/JavaScript at that location. Common Tasks Here are a few snippets that you'll typically need, saving you from reading all the docs in common scenarios: Edit.Toolbar(employee) creates a default toolbar for the content-item employee with all default buttons like edit, change-view, more, etc. Edit.Toolbar(employee, actions: \"edit\") creates a toolbar for the item employee but only with the edit -button. Edit.Toolbar(employee, actions: \"edit,add,remove\") creates a toolbar with three buttons edit , add , remove Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\") creates a toolbar with one button, namely new which will open a new BlogPost form. @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Title = \"Hello\", Color = \"red\" } ) creates a toolbar with one button, namely new which will open a new BlogPost form, and prefills the Title and Color field. TODO TODO MORE SIMPLE EXAMPLES Edit.Toolbar API The Edit.Toolbar() has these parameters target a DynamicEntity content-item, optional this is a content item which will be affected by the toolbar actions string, optional, must be named this is a comma-separated string overriding the default buttons which the toolbar will create, containing command names . contentType string, optional, must be named this is necessary if you want a new button which would open the dialog to create a new item, and you don't have a target-item which already tells the system what type to use. This allows you to create a button for a new \"Category\" and another button for a new \"BlogPost\" etc. prefill object, optional, must be named allows a new dialog to receive values as a prefill, for example to already specify a date, title, category, etc. toolbar object, optional, must be named (v08.06+) a full toolbar configuration object - see the JS documentation for Toolbar . If you use this, you cannot also specify actions , contentType or prefill as those would want to configure the same information. settings object, optional, must be named (v08.06+) the settings used by a toolbar like alignment - see the JS documentation for settings The Toolbar Actions Note: at the moment, the buttons are grouped into bundles like initial buttons list buttons template / view buttons app buttons The actions can be a combination of known button-names. Here's the current JavaScript catalog of commands : The following commands all require target to be set, or they only make sense in a List-setup - see also content and not as data [template-content-data]. new open a dialog to create a new item, requires a target or a contentType parameter edit to edit the current item publish will optionally show the publish-button, but only if the current item is not published. add opens a dialog to create a new item just like new, but will add it below the current item in the content list remove will remove (not delete) this item from the content list moveup will move the item up one position in the content list movedown will move the item down one position in the content list sort will open the sort dialog of the content list replace will open a dialog to swap the current item in the content list Note: the command metadata - is a bit special, not supported in the actions parameter - use the complex toolbar: instead and read the instructions for the JS Commands . For many more commands you should check the JS Commands ), which covers many more like app-import , layout , develop , contenttype , contentitems , app , zone , more etc. More About the Prefill Basically this is a .net object which will be serialized to JSON and used to prefill a new item. Usually you'll just create a new, anonymous object like new { Title = \"xyz\", Date = ... } . example @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Title = \"Hello\", Color = \"red\", Link = \"page:\" + Dnn.Tab.TabID } ) This example will prefill the title, the color and in the link field add a reference to the current page. TODO: get more examples with prefilling a related entity (like a category) a date Multiple Entities Prefil For this you must simply provide an array of strings, like this: @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Tags = new string[] {\"08387a10-1aac-494a-9eb5-1383e31490eb\",\"b498a694-047a-4e51-a285-50f9a64edda1\"} }) Styling the Toolbar As of now there are only limited stying functions: Floating the Toolbar This happens automatically, if a surrounding HTML-tag has a class \"sc-element\". more... What Really Happens with the toolbar As previously noted, the toolbar actually puts some html/js into the page, which the javascript $2sxc object will pick up and work with. Quite a lot happens on the client, and that will be documented some other day. Here just the short version: js runs, picks up Toolbars jc reviews DOM to see what context it's in (either the module-instance or an inner-content) js generates buttons if a button is clicked, an action-manager then executes the correct action on the correct item Notes and Clarifications Enforced Parameter Naming To promote long term API stability, we require all parameters except for the first content-item target to be named when used. <!-- this will work --> @Edit.Toolbar(target: postItem, actions: \"add,edit,more\") @Edit.Toolbar(postItem, actions: \"add\") <!-- this won't work --> @Edit.Toolbar(postItem, \"add\") <!-- this will work --> @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\") <!-- this won't --> @Edit.Toolbar(\"new\", \"BlogPost\") Older @Content.Toolbar Syntax Is Deprecated Note : there was an older @SomeContentItem.Toolbar syntax and this still works, but we ran into architecture issues, so we decided to place all advanced functions into the Edit.Toolbar(...) method. This is the way to go from now on, the old syntax will continue to work but is not recommended any more.

How to use In your app.module.ts , add an import to ContentManagerModule from @2sic.com/dnn-sxc-angular and add it to the imports array. Place the toolbar directives/components in your templates. There are two different ways to place your toolbars, the tag-toolbar (default) and the inline toolbar, depending on the use case. In most cases, you will want to use the tag-toolbar; the inline toolbar is useful when you want to show the toolbar without the need to hover over the target element. Tag-Toolbar To use the tag-toolbar, insert the [sxc-toolbar] directive where you want to place the toolbar, e.g.: <div *ngIf=\"!!reference\" [sxc-toolbar]='{toolbar:{entityId:reference.Id}}'> ... </div> The object being passed to the attribute can contain a toolbar and a settings property, according to HTML Toolbars and Buttons . Inline-Toolbar Place the inline toolbar in your template, for example inside of a table cell: <td> <sxc-toolbar [config]=\"{toolbar:{entityId:reference.Id}}\"></sxc-toolbar> </td> The config object passed to the component follows the same rules as the tag-toolbar ( https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/wiki/html-toolbars-and-buttons )."

    "keywords": "AngularJs 1 Overview Purpose / Description 2sxc contains a special helper called 2sxc4ng which takes care of starting your app inside DNN and providing you with toolbars and data from 2sxc. How to use Until we find time to document everything, here's the short version To use 2sxc4ng you must include a JS file in your template, and you must bootstrap your app using this (not using the standard angularjs bootstrapping) this is to ensure that multiple Angular apps can run on the same page, and to provide your app with the necessary context so it knows what module it's working on, etc. Here's an introduction to that . To get your current sxc-controller there are two objects $2sxc and sxc which you can just include it in your function definition, like module.controller('AppCatalogCtrl', function ($2sxc, sxc, $http, ...) { The sxc is the one you want most, it is already set to your current instance, so you can ask it things like sxc.manage etc. The $2sxc is the same as the global $2sxc object you know from jquery. You could of course also do $2sxc(27).manage to acces the manage, but that's unnecessarily complicated Additional services provided when bootstrapping with 2sxc4ng is content(typename) - a service which requests content-data from the current app / context, can also delete / create items etc. query(queryname) - a service which gets data from app-queries Additional directives sxcToolbar - a create-toolbar directive to provide in-app toolbars to edit/manage etc. for <sxc-toolbar toolbar=\"...\"> tags Todo: a simple full example right here Including All Necessary Files You need three files + your code 2sxc.min.js - only necessary, if you intend to work with 2sxc data items & toolbars, must come before 2sxc4ng Angular - ideally from a CDN 2sxc4ng.min.js - only necessary, if you intend to work with 2sxc data items & toolbars, must come after angular Your code Example: <script src=\"/desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/js/2sxc.api.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"100\"></script> <script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"101\"></script> <script src=\"/desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/js/angularjs/2sxc4ng.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"110\"></script> <script src=\"@App.Path/dist/angular-app.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"120\"></script> Toolbar Directive Quick example - this requires 2sxc 8.8 // a quick sxcToolbar example <li ng-repeat=\"app in apps\"> <sxc-toolbar toolbar='{ \"entityId\": app.EntityId }' settings='{ \"hover\": \"left\", \"align\": \"left\" }'></sxc-toolbar> ... </li> Content Service This is a quick example of the content service Todo: you can find some infos till then in the ( http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng)(http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng ) article Important: you can use the content service to get all of a type get one of a type create one of a type (if permissions have been configured for that type) delete one of a type (permissions...) quick demo of syntax var cSrv = content(\"BlogPosts\"); var onePromise = cSrv.get(740); var allPromise = cSrv.get(); var createPromise = cSrv.create({ \"Title\": \"hello\", \"Body\": \"great article\"}); var deletePromise = cSrv.delete(7740); Query Service This is a quick example of the query service Todo: you can find some infos till then in the ( http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng)(http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng ) article // this example assumes you added the query service in your constructor // it also assumes you created a visual-query called \"All-blog-items\" var qAll = query(\"All-blog-items\"); qAll.get().then(function (result) { ... // some code here }); // this assumes you want to query the data from the current view // so the real items assigned to this instance // or processed inside the view in a PrepareData() method var qCurrent = query(); qCurrent.get().then(function (result) { ... // some code here }); When working with queries that expect parameters, you can pass them in the get() call qAll.get({ data: { \"sort\": \"EntityTitle\" }, }).then(...) Notes and Clarifications On Bootstrapping Just fyi: in 2sxc 6.0 till 2sxc 8.8.0 the AngularJS bootstrapping needed to know the module-id. This was done by either providing an attribute like iid=\"@Dnn.Module.ModuleId\" or for tokens iid=\"[Module:ModuleId]\" providing the mod-id in the app name like sxc-app=\"MyApp-@Dnn.Module.ModuleId\" This is because it needs if for webservice calls. In 2sxc 8.8.1 the bootstrapping will auto-detect the module id, so you don't have to provide it any more.

Examples of such types are configurations of data-sources (like the SqlDataSource in 2sxc 9.8) any kind of input-configuration types (like string-dropdown, etc. starting in 2sxc 9.10) any kind of global types like view metadata etc. This will also be used in the near future to provide app level content-types - probably in 2sxc 9.11 or similar. This will dramatically enhance our ability to upgrade existing apps, as it's easier to detect type-changes. Overview Basically the app-repository is a folder which contains content-type definitions in a contenttype sub folder. As of 2sxc 9.7, this is located in /desktopmodules/ToSIC_SexyContent/.data/ We're using the .data folder as this is protected from external browsing.

This is so we can continue to test and design the new content-types before releasing them \"in the wild\". Limitations As of now (2sxc 9.7) the system will pick up the content-types stored there and everything works. BUT there is no built-in mechanism to edit these. We (2sic) can easily create content-types in a normal 2sxc and export them to json for this purpose, but as of now there is no GUI to do so.
